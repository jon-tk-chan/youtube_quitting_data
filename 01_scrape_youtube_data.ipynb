I can boldly say that I am among the the few that has actually quit their job to try to make it on my own. In this past year, I have learned that the concept of quitting your job to follow your passion is a lot different than how most people imagine. In this video, I share four different lessons I have learned this past year from quitting my job and trying to make it on my own. \\n\\n1. It Is Extremely Hard To Make It On Your Own\\n\\nAlthough being an employee of a company isn't always enjoyable, there are many benefits of working as an employee for a company like a predictable paycheck, a set schedule, a defined role, benefits, and your employer takes out your taxes. All of these benefits make you not have to worry about so many things besides doing your job. Whereas, when you become self-employed, income becomes unpredictable, you're always working, you have no guidance, you have to figure out your own benefits, and you need help from an accountant. If you decide to pursue your own path, you are putting a bunch of extra pressures on yourself that make your work harder.\\n\\n2. You Enter A World Of Uncertainty\\n\\nWhen you decide to quit your job, you enter this world of uncertainty where you can't plan out your life as much. The future becomes more unknown so you have to put certain life moves on hold, the future of your career isn't clear, and you generally can't think in the future. Living in such an uncertain world can be scary as you never know what is going to happen and many people could probably not handle living with this amount of uncertainty. If you decide to pursue your own path, you enter a very uncertain world.\\n\\n3. Your Work Becomes Your Life\\n\\nIf you want to build something on your own, there has to be this component of obsession in order to succeed. You can't come in with the mindset of just wanting to try things out and see what happens, but you really have to be ambitious and motivated in order to have a 1% chance of it working out. It will only work if you take the steps to make it work. And when you live with this attitude, your work and your life become intertwined, which comes with many sacrifices. If you decide to pursue your own path, work becomes a huge part of your life and for many people, the sacrifices might not be worth it.\\n\\n4. This Uncertain Path Is 100% Worth It\\n\\nThis past year of being self employed has been difficult full of many challenges and a lot of learning. And although it has been difficult, the experience has made me a stronger, bolder person. When you choose to take a chance and pursue your own path, you end up challenging yourself and learning things that you can only learn if you put yourself in a sink or swim situation. If you are considering quitting your job to pursue your own thing, there are many things to consider. It isn't as glamorous as many people describe. In my experience, however, it has been 100% worth it.\\n\\n**Links above are affiliate links where if you click and order, I will receive a commission at no cost to you. **\", \"Roll by ADP - Ridiculously Easy Payroll!

I did to the tune of $500,000/year, and I did it by learning the lesson I talk about in today's video. Quitting a my job was one of the best decisions I've ever made because it helped me become who I am today. The difference between who you are and who you will become 10 to 20 years from now are the decisions you make TODAY. If you want to change, you can start by changing your surroundings.\\n\\nOne of the big reasons a lot of people are suffering from anxiety is because deep down they know they could be doing bigger and better things. If you're one of these people, then this video is for you.\\n\\nWhen you work at a corporate 9-to-5, you are on borrowed time. You won't break the mold unless you scale up in pay, and down in company size. You need to have skin in the game. I'll explain how you can get it in this video. \\n\\nHave you taken a big risk in your life? Did you quit a good job to take a chance on something uncertain?

I started YouTube a year and a half ago at an extremely slow pace, posting videos for about 9 months until I finally had 1 video that took the channel off. Shortly after seeing a potential in the channel, I decided to go all in and quit my job about 7 months ago. In this video, I reflect on this journey and share, \"10 Life Lessons I\\'ve Learned Since Starting YouTube.\"\\n\\n1. Never Stop Dreaming\\n\\nThe reason I originally started this channel was because I was unhappy with the direction my life was going and wanted the next great adventure in life. My job left me in this routine of doing similar things every day and due to having a high pay, I noticed that it scared me away from dreaming in life. I believe it is important to prioritize dreaming in your life and never stop dreaming no matter how old you get. \\n\\n2. You Don’t Need To Know What You’re Doing, You Just Need To Start\\n\\nOftentimes, we think that before we do something we need to know everything about it; however, regardless of whatever you do, in the beginning, you are going to suck at it. When you first start something you lack experience and expertise; however, you should never let that prevent you from starting. It is important to just take the first step and you can learn as you go.\\n\\n3. The Universe Is Conspiring In Your Favor, Even Though You May Not Understand How\\n\\nMany people will give up early in the process of pursuing their dreams because they think that \"it just wasn\\'t meant to be.\" Whatever you choose to do in life, you need hope and faith to keep moving. You need to believe in yourself and your abilities despite all odds. And as you continue on your journey, if you work hard and put in the effort, the universe will eventually cut you some slack.\\n\\n4. It Can’t Just Be About Money\\n\\nWhatever you want to do in life, there has to be some reason other than money. If money is your only reason of being you will either quickly give up or will feel empty about the work you are doing. It is important to find enjoyment or meaning out of your work to help you push when times get tough.\\n\\n5. An Overnight Success Never Happens Overnight\\n\\nIt took me 9 months and 30 videos until I finally had a video take off, and although the success may have seemed to be from a single video, the real reason came from what I learned in those previous 9 months. Even when something seems like an \"overnight success\" it is normally from a lot of effort that nobody sees.\\n\\n6. The Biggest Risk In Life Is Not Taking One\\n\\nIn life, we often question things that are good for us like taking a chance to do something we are passionate about and think of everything that can go wrong; however, we don\\'t question the risks of staying where we are. I believe that the biggest risk in life is not taking one and to push past the fear and give your dreams a shot.\\n\\n7. Freedom Isn’t Going To Meet You Halfway, You Have To Chase It Everyday\\n\\nThere is often this glamorized image of quitting your job that the second you leave, thing will start changing; however, this is not true. In order to have freedom in your life, you have to actively chase it every day. Freedom is not definite, so you can not take it for granted. It is something you have to embrace as hard as you can for as long as you have it. \\n\\n8. Success Isn’t Owned. It’s Rented, And Rent Is Due Everyday\\n\\nI used to think that once you had success in life, things would start coming easier, but this is not true. Success is not definite. Once you have success in life, it does not mean that you\\'re going to continue having success. Success is something you have to fight for every day or you will lose it. \\n\\n9. Success Is Just Failure\\n\\nSuccessful people are people who fail the most; however, instead of giving up, they learn from their failures and move forward. Most of the time when you pursue success, you are going to fail, but eventually after so much failing, you will have some success. And then success will go away because it isn\\'t permanent. \\n\\n10. Everyone Should Take A Chance At Least Once In Their Life\\n\\nI took a chance with this channel to do something different and pursue something I am passionate about. This experience has changed me so much as a person and I continue to grow every day as I am constantly challenged. I believe that everyone should take a chance at least once in their lives to do something crazy!!\\n\\n\\n** Links above are affiliate links where if you click and order, I will receive a commission at no cost to you. **', 'Remember, you are more than your career.

Or maybe you’re not satisfied with your current career and want a change.  Well, you’ve come to the right place.   \\n \\nAs a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience hiring thousands of employees at all levels into major corporations, I’m going to spill the beans on how to get noticed by recruiters, start getting more interviews, navigate through each step of the hiring process, and ultimately land the dream job you deserve.   \\n \\nBut that’s not all - I firmly believe that to truly experience career success, you need to think bigger.   Multiple streams of income and budgeting are crucial to forming a layoff-free lifestyle and helping you achieve your goals.    \\n \\nIf these are things you’re struggling with, that’s what I specialize in.   I’ve got a website called A Life After Layoff.   It’s loaded with tips and tricks for getting noticed, interviewed, and hired by your dream company.    Make sure you check it out!   \\n \\nI’ve got weekly videos coming at you, so make sure to subscribe.   You won’t want to miss a post.

The trend of employees choosing to not go above and beyond their jobs in ways that include refusing to answer emails during evenings or weekends, or skipping extra assignments that fall outside their core duties, is catching on, especially among Gen Zers.\\n\\nZaid Khan, 24, an engineer from New York, popularized this trend with his viral Tiktok video in July.\\n\\n\"You are still performing your duties, but you are no longer subscribing to the hustle culture mentally that work has to be our life,\" Khan says in his video. \"The reality is, it\\'s not, and your worth as a person is not defined by your labor.\"\\n\\nIn the U.S., quiet quitting could also be a backlash to so-called hustle culture — the 24/7 startup grind popularized by figures like Gary Vaynerchuk and others.\\n\\n\"Quiet quitting is an antidote to hustle culture,\" said Nadia De Ala, founder of Real You Leadership, who \"quietly quit\" her job about five years ago. \"It is almost direct resistance and disruption of hustle culture. And I think it\\'s exciting that more people are doing it.\"\\n\\nLast year, the Great Resignation dominated the economic news cycle. Now, during the second half of 2022, it\\'s the quiet quitting trend that\\'s gaining momentum at a time when the rate of U.S. productivity is raising some concern. Data on U.S. worker productivity posted its biggest annual drop in the second quarter.\\n\\nSo, why is this trend on the rise?

But most of us never quit our jobs, we just dream about it. There are a number of reasons why people stay working at a job they hate, but the #1 reason is probably for the 'security' it provides. However, in many cases this 'security' isn't real. And even if it is, is it really worth sacrificing your life and sanity for it?

      "Many people have the dream of quitting their job to pursue their own passion in life; however, very few people actually do it. I can boldly say that I am among the the few that has actually quit their job to try to make it on my own. In this past year, I have learned that the concept of quitting your job to follow your passion is a lot different than how most people imagine. In this video, I share four different lessons I have learned this past year from quitting my job and trying to make it on my own. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. It Is Extremely Hard To Make It On Your Own\n",
      "\n",
      "Although being an employee of a company isn't always enjoyable, there are many benefits of working as an employee for a company like a predictable paycheck, a set schedule, a defined role, benefits, and your employer takes out your taxes. All of these benefits make you not have to worry about so many things besides doing your job. Whereas, when you become self-employed, income becomes unpredictable, you're always working, you have no guidance, you have to figure out your own benefits, and you need help from an accountant. If you decide to pursue your own path, you are putting a bunch of extra pressures on yourself that make your work harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. You Enter A World Of Uncertainty\n",
      "\n",
      "When you decide to quit your job, you enter this world of uncertainty where you can't plan out your life as much. The future becomes more unknown so you have to put certain life moves on hold, the future of your career isn't clear, and you generally can't think in the future. Living in such an uncertain world can be scary as you never know what is going to happen and many people could probably not handle living with this amount of uncertainty. If you decide to pursue your own path, you enter a very uncertain world.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Your Work Becomes Your Life\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to build something on your own, there has to be this component of obsession in order to succeed. You can't come in with the mindset of just wanting to try things out and see what happens, but you really have to be ambitious and motivated in order to have a 1% chance of it working out. It will only work if you take the steps to make it work. And when you live with this attitude, your work and your life become intertwined, which comes with many sacrifices. If you decide to pursue your own path, work becomes a huge part of your life and for many people, the sacrifices might not be worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. This Uncertain Path Is 100% Worth It\n",
      "\n",
      "This past year of being self employed has been difficult full of many challenges and a lot of learning. And although it has been difficult, the experience has made me a stronger, bolder person. When you choose to take a chance and pursue your own path, you end up challenging yourself and learning things that you can only learn if you put yourself in a sink or swim situation. If you are considering quitting your job to pursue your own thing, there are many things to consider. It isn't as glamorous as many people describe. In my experience, however, it has been 100% worth it.\n",

      "ladies and gentlemen damasik Caballeros no matter who you are I think that deep down inside we all have this longing to break out of this monotonous nine to five grind and have more time to do the things we enjoy it's explore our passions and be our own boss I think that we all have this longing for more we all dream of the freedom the discovery and the growth that comes from taking a chance to pursue your own path in life however although it's a dream held by many it's pursued by few most people dream of taking a chance in life but very few people actually take the action to turn it into their reality however I can say I can boldly say that I am one of the few people that has taken the action to pursue something more in life because about a year ago this month I told my boss I quit I quit my job about a year ago and this past year has been one of the most educational years of my life I have learned so much from the experience of being self-employed and trying to make it on my own and in this video I want to share the unglamorous reality of what it means to quit your job and pursue your own path because it's a lot different than how most people describe it it's a lot different than how you might imagine it and so I'm going to share four lessons four big lessons I have learned this past year that have come from this experience of quitting my job and pursuing my own path in the first lesson is that it's extremely hard to make it on your own after a year of this experience of trying to make it on my own I can confidently say that the path of quitting your job and trying to make it on your own isn't for most people because once you leave that stable job with a paycheck you quickly see the beauty of having a job because when you have a job you have a predictable paycheck set work schedule a defined role depending on your job you might have benefits like Health Care a 401k plan sick days and paid time off and your employer takes out your taxes although jobs might suck there are a lot of benefits to being an employee to a company that we often take for granted and if you're thinking about quitting your job to pursue your own path you should know that things will become a lot harder I mean for me personally I never know what I'm going to make I work all the time I don't know what I'm doing 99 percent of the time my health care costs six times more than when I had a job if I want a day off or I'm sick I work harder or face the consequences and I have to hire an accountant to help me with taxes when you try to make it on your own Things become a lot more complex trust me ladies and gentlemen I mean I am making half of what I was making at my past job and I have two three four five six times more things to think about and when you decide to quit your job and pursue your own path you're voluntarily choosing to make things harder than they need to be After experiencing the difficulties of this path for the past year I can confidently say that most people are probably better off as an employee most people will probably be a lot happier with a stable job in all the security and benefits that it provides you have to be a little bit crazy to pursue this path because you're voluntarily choosing to make things a lot harder than they need to be there's pros and cons to both in the second lesson that I've learned this past year is you enter a world of uncertainty now I have a few friends that have also quit their jobs and are trying to make it on their own but in different ways as you know I'm the internet Entertainer but I know someone that's freelancing I know someone else that's starting their own business and although we're pursuing these different paths whenever we get together and we talk about the lifestyle of trying to make it on your own or becoming this entrepreneur we all have one thing in common and that's the uncertainty of this path now I believe that whatever path you choose to follow in life you will never have complete certainty however with these benefits that I mentioned of being an employee of a company it comes with a lot of certainty you have the ability to plan out your life more and do things like planned by a home or know the path moving forward in your career or just generally think in the future you have a decent amount of certainty in your life whereas when you decide to pursue your own path in life you enter this world of uncertainty where you can't think too far in the future and you have to put certain life moves on hold your career path is unknown and generally the future is unknown when you choose to try to make it on your own you're choosing to enter and you're choosing to live in this world of uncertainty where you don't know what's going to happen you don't know what the future was going to look like I mean in this past year I haven't had the ability to think more than three months in the future because I have no idea what my life will look like in three months nonetheless a year and it's a scary world to live and it's hard to live with this much uncertainty and if you think too much into it you'll have a mental breakdown and it doesn't matter if you're trying to be a YouTuber or if you're trying to start your own business or if you're trying to be a freelancer everyone that I've spoken to that pursues this path talks so much about the uncertainty of it and after you live your life with so much uncertainty it just seems crazy to voluntarily choose to live with this amount of uncertainty I mean most people wouldn't be able to handle and stay sane in this amount of its uncertainty and if you choose to pursue a path of trying to make it on your own know that you might have more freedom and you might have more time but it's hard to enjoy it when you're faced with so much uncertainty in life it's a very bizarre world to live in in the third lesson that I've learned this past year is your work becomes your life if you decide to quit your job and pursue your own path in life in order to succeed or just in order to have a Fighting Chance of succeeding I think there has to be this component of obsession you can't come in with the mindset of I'm just going to try this out and see what happens because if you come in with that mindset you won't be able to push through all the challenges and all the difficulties that you encounter instead you have to come with the mindset if you want to have a Fighting Chance a one percent chance of succeeding you have to come in with the mindset of this cannot fail this has to work when you're trying to build your own thing the only way it'll work I believe is when you become obsessed with it you can't treat it like a job where you end work at five work 40 hours a week and have weekends off but you really have to hustle and put in the work because the only way it's going to work is if you make it work and you have to be extremely ambitious and extremely motivated even when you're seeing no results and what happens when you live your life this way for so long is that your life and your work become intertwined and it's no longer what you do but it's who you are and it sounds cool to think that you're following your passion and you're doing what you love but this mindset and this lifestyle comes with a lot of sacrifices it's not as glamorous as you might think because you often have to work on weekends you can't always come to social events and you can get overwhelmed by all the uncertainty of it when you choose to try to make it on your own your work in your life are no longer separate but your work just becomes this extension of who you are and you have to be extremely motivated and put in a lot of effort in order to have a Fighting Chance of building it into something and you could put in a hundred and twenty percent every single day and it still might not work out but at least you're not going to live this life of what ifs and this lifestyle comes with a lot of sacrifices and depending who you are these sacrifices might not be worth it in the final lesson that I have learned this past year is that this uncertain path is 100 worth it as I've explained in this video when you quit your job and decide to pursue your own path you're met with a life of unnecessary challenges uncertainty and sacrifice and so the question about this path is why would anybody voluntarily choose to put themselves through this why would anybody voluntarily choose to bring all these unnecessary hardships on themselves and make their life more difficult than it needs to be well what I have learned in this past year is that it's because you become a stronger Bolder person despite all the challenges of this experience this past year has been one of the most personal growth years of my life I have been challenged in ways I have never been challenged I have learned things that I couldn't have learned if I hadn't put myself in this sink or swim situation and the further I get in this experience the less I care if I'm going to succeed or if I'm going to fail but the more I'm focused on the journey if there is one thing that this uncertain path teaches you it is how to operate in the present how to stop worrying about the future in fully immerse yourself in the present moment and it makes you feel truly alive because even though it is extremely challenging you know that you're living life on your terms and in life we shouldn't always embrace the easy and safe route but we should do things that challenge us to put us outside of our comfort zone and put us in these sink or swim situations because these uncertain moments are the moments when you discover who you are in What You're Made Of in regardless of how much it hurts in the moment and regardless of whether you fail or succeed when it's all said and done if you gave it a shot you don't have to live this life of what ifs and because you chose this path you come out a stronger in a bolder person and so so if you're deciding if you're thinking about quitting your job and pursuing your own path know that it is a not an easy path and there's a lot of pros and cons to consider but this path in my experience has been worth it it hasn't been easy but it has been worth it and with that muchas gracias video 129 Noble Chico\n",
