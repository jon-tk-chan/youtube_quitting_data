'actually get', 'better and how do they get', 'worse and um you I had help along the', 'way I had a really good partner who was', 'a pain management doc at my first job', 'and he really clued me into um a lot of', \"a lot of the things I'm going to explain\", 'here but I just started asking', 'patients like everything I could think', 'of um what do you what do you normally', \"do what's your job what do you eat what\", 'do you drink do you smoke do you do you', 'elicit drugs do you uh you have a lot of', 'friends do you', \"you how's your family are you stressed\", 'out do you sleep', 'well I I just would ask all my patients', 'just kind of this whole bunch of', 'questions about their life and what I', 'found', 'was that', 'um', 'patients that did certain things would', 'get', \"better and patients who wouldn't do\", 'those things would get worse my surgery', 'might help them out a little bit but', 'they would get worse after', 'that um and those things that I I saw', \"were the following it's um people that\", 'got', 'better people that', 'healed they were doing following and not', 'exactly but in general and this is my', 'observation', 'uh they they', 'were having a diet well diet seemed to', 'be the most important the food that', 'people ate and the liquids they', 'drink the ones that would heal up', 'they had a low salt diet like not it', \"wasn't really\", 'salty and most of them ate mostly', 'plant-based Foods you know like', 'vegetable vegetables fruits whole grains', 'beans and this is not this is not like a', \"vegan rant or anything I I I'm not vegan\", 'I enjoy a steak or sushi every once in a', \"while I'm just describing what what I\", 'saw over N9 years of doing spine', 'surgery people that got better were', 'having a mostly plant-based diet they', \"weren't eating too much animal foods and\", 'they were definitely not eating salty', 'and they would do things that would make', 'them sweat like exercise being outside', 'hiking like this going to a', 'sauna', 'um or they live in a warm', \"place um they didn't\", \"smoke they didn't drink\", 'much uh', 'they usually had a good soci social', 'support like uh loved ones family', 'members', 'children', 'friends', 'um like a way to socialize they would', 'sleep they would sleep like eight hours', \"every day and they weren't stressed out\", 'or they if they had a stressful job or', 'something they they they found a way', 'to like be mindful or meditate or like', 'just be present', 'and um release the stress back into the', 'Universe', \"um that's what I\", 'saw and I saw that the people who did', 'that they would heal so quickly that I', \"couldn't operate on them I mean\", 'sometimes I could but if I was booked', 'like three or four weeks', 'out a lot of times people would that', 'were doing that they would heal before I', 'could do the surgery that I thought', 'would fix the', 'problem and the opposite was true you', 'know patients that patients that', 'um so they smoked like a chimney they', 'sat on the couch and they ate hot dogs', 'all day they had no friends they were', 'super stressed', 'out and um', \"they didn't sleep\", 'well yeah th those patients like I I', 'could do a really good surgery I would', 'get them temporarily better but 6 months', 'year later the same part of their back', 'would have a recurrent problem or a', 'different part a different joint of', 'their back would have a similar', 'problem and I would operate on them and', 'they might get better for 6 months and', 'then', 'yeah then the same thing would happen so', \"it's the it's the Leaky Roof\", 'problem so that that was my that was my', \"aha moment it's like\", \"oh I know what's going\", 'on wait to actually heal you you need to', 'like eat a certain', 'way sleep a', 'lot not be stressed out I have a good', 'social network exercise move your body', 'stretch if you do all those', 'things you', \"heal and when your body heals it doesn't\", 'just', 'heal worn out

'hair', '[Music]', 'issues when when your body heals it', 'heals', 'everything', 'and that actually became a huge problem', \"and uh let me explain why that's a huge\", 'problem because most people will say wa', 'how is that a problem that you figured', 'out how people are', \"healing uh it's a problem because our\", \"medical system isn't set up isn't set up\", 'this way our our', \"um our you know I'm I'm not knocking any\", 'hospital or group that I worked with', \"I've I had the privilege to work with\", 'really amazing people and amazing', 'hospitals amazing', 'institutions but the way that everything', \"is set up in the whole country it's not\", 'any particular Hospital the way things', 'are set up is that the hospital needs to', 'make', 'money they need to make money they need', 'to they need to', 'grow economically they need to grow', 'economically and the problem there is', 'that if you figure out a way to help', 'patients heal', \"and that in that way doesn't include a\", 'pill or a', 'surgery', 'well then the hospital and the doctor', 'are in big trouble', 'because if you figure out a way to help', \"people heal and you can't charge them\", 'for', \"it well then you've just um worked\", 'yourself out of a', \"job let's just say let's just say um\", \"like for example there's a hospital in a\", \"town and um you know there's an x amount\", 'of people with back', 'problems um and the hospital that', \"there's a doctor say it was like me Dr\", 'Gooby was', \"doing we'll just say 100 spine surgeries\", 'in a year to fix those the people in the', \"community's backs and the hospital got\", 'paid Dr Gooby got play', 'paid and um they Contin every year 100', 'people needed surgery from Dr', \"Gooby well the hospital's happy Dr Gooby\", 'gets paid Dr gooy may not be happy with', 'his life', \"but he's getting paid and the do the\", 'hospital is getting', 'paid but if Dr Gooby figures', 'out', 'hey', 'um yeah you know what this surgery can', 'help some people but really the best', 'thing that people can do is eat a', 'certain', 'way exercise', 'sleep meditate be mindful you not be', 'stressed hang out with their loved ones', 'and friends and then their back problems', 'will get', 'better and if Dr Gooby actually', 'recommended that to his patients and', 'they actually did get better', \"well it's a big problem for Dr goobie's\", 'paycheck and the', \"hospital cuz let's say in that town\", \"let's say\", 'everybody everybody ate more veggies and', 'fruits they really watched the salt', 'intake they did things that made them', 'sweat like being outside in the summer', 'exercising enjoying fresh air and the', 'nature and and uh spending time with', 'their loved ones and they slept 8 hours', 'every day and they they meditated and', \"they weren't stressed out let's just say\", 'everybody who had back problems in that', 'town did that and they got', 'better they', 'healed then nobody needs spine surgery', \"anymore in fact they probably don't need\", 'a lot of things', 'anymore and', \"then Dr guy's office is empty\", \"and the hospital's operating room is\", 'empty at least for Dr Gooby', \"surgeries now I'm not saying that that's\", 'exactly what happened because not', \"everyone's going to do all those things\", 'that', 'I that I talked about but I had a lot of', 'patients that did do those things and', 'they got better I never had to operate', 'on them and they were very happy that', 'they never had to be operated on and', 'they got better better that the pain', 'went', 'away and um yeah so that that', 'was that was what I figured out over N9', 'years and', 'I I still did surgery because you know', 'not everybody could can do all those', 'things I talked about I mean just', 'practically', 'speaking and so I I I still did', 'surgery but I really felt', 'like really felt like the focus of', \"medicine wasn't in the right place it\", \"wasn't in healing it was in making money\", 'from surgeries and pills and', 'images whatever you can make money', \"from uh again I'm not knocking any\", 'particular place that I work', 'I work for very good hospitals people', 'have good intentions but the incentives', 'are not not right in the whole system', \"this whole country's medical system\", 'probably not just this country but most', \"countries um it's not about prevention\", \"it's about\", 'therapies so yeah once I once I figured', 'out this', 'problem or figured out what was going on', 'it was a huge problem for me', 'ethically I was doing surgeries that I', \"knew weren't fixing the underlying\", 'problem they may be fixing the drywall', 'and taking out the insulation and', 'putting in brand new insulation and', 'putting a brand new drywall and', 'some pretty color of paint on the wall', \"but it wasn't fixing the Leaky\", 'Roof', 'um and', \"so I didn't know what to do I I I was\", \"doing a job that I didn't believe in\", 'anymore it was the way I was getting', \"paid and I don't know how to do any\", \"other job at that time my wife wasn't\", 'working I was the only', \"paycheck we don't have kids thankfully\", 'makes things a lot easier uh we have', \"dupy our doggy our doggy child and she's\", \"7 years old and but yeah we don't we\", \"don't have like a a human\", 'child and um yeah I I was thinking well', \"I'm the only paycheck I I need to keep\", 'working I need to keep going to this job', \"that I don't believe in\", 'anymore and that tore me', 'apart I gained 40', 'lbs uh', 'I was really sad I was really', 'angry',

or a week or week and a half each', 'month', 'and do something else something that', 'makes me feel good like being out here', 'being out in', 'nature uh the rest of the time and my my', 'wife you know I was I said earlier that', \"she's\", 'amazing she said', \"I see what you're going through\", \"I've I've lived with you through\", 'it you should just', 'quit and I I said what H how can I quit', \"you know you're not you're not working\", 'yet', \"she's she was going to school for a\", 'second career and', 'and she said well you', \"know we'll be okay\", 'we we saved up some', \"money

keep going\", \"back but I didn't know what I was going\", 'to do instead for', 'work but I knew that I would die if I', 'kept going', 'back so with my wife', 'support I went to my job and I said hey', \"I can't do this\", 'anymore I will do it for another I think', \"it was nine months at that time I'll do\", 'it for another nine months until you can', 'find someone to replace me so that our', 'that hospital still have a spine', 'surgeon', 'um so I I I I just worked another nine', 'months and I', 'quit and nobody understood why I quit', 'I I would try to explain but this video', 'is probably already 40 minutes long and', \"people don't have 40 minutes to listen\", 'to me explain why I', 'quit you know so I would tell them oh', \"yeah I was burnt out or um it's just too\", 'stressful I I just want to take a break', 'or', 'um it said I said all kinds of things', \"like like that I mean they're all true\", \"but they weren't the full\", 'picture', 'um and you at first I was like I was', 'really embarrassed to', \"say that I'm quitting and that I have no\", 'plan of what to do afterwards that was', 'embarrassing', 'too', 'um but', 'after after some time had passed and a', 'lot of people had asked me that question', 'and I told a lot of people I have no', \"idea what I'm going to do\", 'afterwards it actually felt good if if', 'it feels good', \"to not have a plan it's\", \"um it's freeing it's I got because I\", \"don't have a plan I I don't have to be\", \"anywhere I don't have to do something at\", 'a certain', 'time um', 'and then I just kind of like leaned into', \"it and someone asked me oh what's your\", \"plan I said I don't\", 'know and I felt good about it and I', 'could tell they felt embarrassed for', 'me they felt uncomfortable where where', 'whereas I was feeling uncomfortable', 'initially saying that', 'but yeah over time I you know I I just', \"accept it like I know I can't do\", \"neurosurgery anymore and I don't have a\", \"plan and I'm quitting and I won't have a\", 'paycheck uh I got I got some money saved', 'up and I can live off of that for a', \"while but I've got to work again at some\", \"point I can't retire um but yeah no I\", 'need to do this I I knew I needed to do', 'this and I and I did it so that was last', 'September I', \"quit haven't gone back\", 'and um you know at', 'first oh so so you know this is I think', 'what most people call a midlife', 'crisis um but I would say the crisis', 'part was really the nine years that I', 'was super unhappy that was the', \"crisis so I think that's what most\", 'people call a midlife crisis', 'is what I would say was those 9 years I', 'was really unhappy I I I knew something', \"was wrong and I knew I couldn't live\", 'like that but I I felt stuck felt stuck', \"in that situation felt like I couldn't\", 'um Escape it that was a', \"crisis now that I've\", \"left I haven't been this happy in my\", 'whole', 'life it does not feel like a crisis', 'right now I mean maybe financially it', \"might be a crisis that's some point\", 'but', \"I I've never been this happy before\", 'ever it feels', 'right um', 'so so what I did when I quit', 'is I just walked a lot outside cuz I you', 'I had gained 40 lbs like I said earlier', 'and yeah I ate healthy I slept a lot', 'because you know a neurosurgeon they', \"don't sleep very well because they're\", 'they keep getting called about', 'emergencies you I nobody was calling me', 'I slept every night for a really long', 'time and I walked and I spent time', 'outside I spent time with my dog

social networks that tried', 'to start yeah like 99% of them failed', 'second is your passive cash flow', 'business so this is going to be', 'something like a Blog YouTube channel a', 'real estate portfolio stuff like that', 'and third is going to be your', 'service-based business this is exactly', 'what it sounds like doing some type of', 'service for a client this could be Web', 'Design

'business I do not want you guys to focus', 'on the type of business I myself do not', \"have any experience with this I've never\", 'built a crazy big company like that and', 'I think for most people that is not the', 'way to get into entrepreneurship the', 'biggest reason why people quit their', 'entrepreneurial journey is because they', \"don't see results fast enough and with\", \"those types of businesses it's very\", \"likely that you won't see results for\", 'years so that leaves us the other two', \"and now what we're going to do is\", 'basically compare the pros and cons of', \"these

basically what it's\", \"going to look like it's going to start\", 'off really really really slow you', \"probably won't see much results at all\", \"and at some point it's going to go up\", 'like that right this is essentially zero', 'and then with the service based business', \"it's going to be something more like\", 'this okay like that should be like that', 'and at some point it can also go

not the best thing to do', 'especially if you want to get out of', \"your job as soon as possible let's also\", 'introduce your current income so CI', \"let's say that's something like this\", \"right slowly goes up over time and we'll\", 'mark that as 60k for example now the', 'thing you want to ask yourself is how', 'long do you wait until you actually quit', \"your job for most people if they don't\", \"like their job they're going to want to\", 'quit as soon as possible right they', \"don't want to be stuck in that job for\", 'that long so this is basically that', 'point where the

it can be 3 months 6 months 12', 'months it can be even longer the main', 'point is that this is just much much', 'faster than this time it takes for the', 'passive cash flow business to exceed',

might be', 'thinking this is probably capped out for', 'the service based business but you can', 'actually make it go up like that and', \"we'll talk about that later on this\", 'video so as you can

is\", 'not super in person then you can', 'absolutely post on other sites like', 'fiver or upwork that can be a great way', 'to to start getting your first clients', 'so step six is you want to charge

I', 'would have been a millionaire so many years sooner\\nif I got rid of my job and focused on my business.', 'I literally have missed out on the opportunities\\nthat I now have because I was afraid.

So,\", \"let me give you some tips on how I quit my job and\\nmore importantly, how you can do it too. So, let's\", 'talk about the process of how you solve for this\\nfear. So, the first step (and this is the easiest', \"thing to do) is what is your fear based in? What\\nare you afraid of? Are you afraid that you're not\", 'going to have enough money? Then solve for it. You\\ncan easily create a number and say, \"Okay, well', 'if I have $3,000 then I\\'m quitting.\" Or you can\\nsay, \"I need $2,000\" or $5,000. My suggestion is', \"make up an answer. So, whatever it is that\\nyou're afraid of if you're afraid that you\", \"don't have enough money for your bills, then get\\nrid of certain bills. If you think that you need a\", \"certain amount of money, get that money saved. And\\nagain, it doesn't have to be saved. You literally\", 'can get a credit card a loan or a line of credit\\nto have money sitting somewhere so that you can', \"feel more secure. It's really not about the\\nmoney though. So, even if you don't have\", \"all of the money that you want, you still need\\nto face your fear. You're still going to have to\", 'overcome that and you still should probably\\nmove forward anyway. Because in most cases,', \"you're going to feel the fear and do it anyway.\\nBecause this is how millionaires work. There's\", \"never going to be a time that you're not afraid\\nespecially if you're a person that is not rich.\", \"Most people that are not rich, the reason why\\nwe're not rich is because we don't have the\", \"skills. We don't have the mindset to be rich. So,\\nas we grow to that, as we start to become that,\", \"then we will have fears and we will\\nhave to overcome them. It's natural,\", \"it's normal. There's no way that you just come\\naround walking around as a baby and you're like,\", '\"Oh, big bad entrepreneur. Like, yeah, give me a\\nmillion dollars and a million dollars for that.\"', \"No. You're afraid. You will feel the fear. Feel\\nthe fear. Do it anyway. The next thing you want\", 'to do is set a date. Set a date that you are going\\nto quit. What is your quit date? Is it 6 months', 'from now? Is it a year from now? Is it 3 months\\nfrom now? What is the date? Literally, I want you', \"once you decide that you are quitting your job,\\nbecause you're watching this. You're quitting your\", 'job. Now, pull out your phone look at the calendar\\nand pick a date that you are quitting. Write that', 'date down. Start putting it in your journal\\nand start working backwards from that date.', \"It's super easy. This is what I did. And this will\\nhelp you start to overcome the fear of quitting\", \"your job because like I said, I don't think you\\nshould just up and quit your job. I don't think\", \"that that's the process. It's not going to work.\\nTrust me. I tried it. It's a lot easier and a more\", 'manageable for you as a person that is growing to\\ngrow into that. And as you start to talk yourself', \"into the fact that you are going to quit. I know\\nthis sounds crazy. I do. I know you're like,\", '\"What are you talking about?\" But it\\'s true. It\\'s\\na process. And almost everyone that I\\'ve talked', 'to that had to quit their job, they have this\\nexact same feeling and experience. So, this is an', \"easy solution. You write down the date, make it\\nat least three months from now. Usually, that's\", \"how long it will take to kind of just convince\\nyourself that this is the right decision. That's\", \"usually the shortest amount of time. I've seen\\npeople do it in 2 months or a month. But usually,\", \"they end up running back because they didn't have\\nenough time to let that idea sit with them like,\", '\"Look, I\\'m quitting. I\\'m quitting.\" And then\\njust kind of start talking yourself into it. So,', 'say for example you make your goal 90 days from\\nnow. You then tomorrow will say, \"In 89 days, I\\'m', 'quitting. In 88 days, I\\'m quitting. In 87 days,\\nI\\'m quitting.

It's almost like you have to\\nprogram and trick yourself into quitting your job.\", \"You have this fear and it's not going away. Just\\nlike quitting anything, you have to usually have\", \"a process. Most people can't just stop eating\\nhamburgers or cookies.
