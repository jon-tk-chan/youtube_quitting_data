I started YouTube a year and a half ago at an extremely slow pace, posting videos for about 9 months until I finally had 1 video that took the channel off. Shortly after seeing a potential in the channel, I decided to go all in and quit my job about 7 months ago. In this video, I reflect on this journey and share, \"10 Life Lessons I\\'ve Learned Since Starting YouTube.\"\\n\\n1. Never Stop Dreaming\\n\\nThe reason I originally started this channel was because I was unhappy with the direction my life was going and wanted the next great adventure in life. My job left me in this routine of doing similar things every day and due to having a high pay, I noticed that it scared me away from dreaming in life. I believe it is important to prioritize dreaming in your life and never stop dreaming no matter how old you get. \\n\\n2. You Don’t Need To Know What You’re Doing, You Just Need To Start\\n\\nOftentimes, we think that before we do something we need to know everything about it; however, regardless of whatever you do, in the beginning, you are going to suck at it. When you first start something you lack experience and expertise; however, you should never let that prevent you from starting. It is important to just take the first step and you can learn as you go.\\n\\n3. The Universe Is Conspiring In Your Favor, Even Though You May Not Understand How\\n\\nMany people will give up early in the process of pursuing their dreams because they think that \"it just wasn\\'t meant to be.\" Whatever you choose to do in life, you need hope and faith to keep moving. You need to believe in yourself and your abilities despite all odds. And as you continue on your journey, if you work hard and put in the effort, the universe will eventually cut you some slack.\\n\\n4. It Can’t Just Be About Money\\n\\nWhatever you want to do in life, there has to be some reason other than money. If money is your only reason of being you will either quickly give up or will feel empty about the work you are doing. It is important to find enjoyment or meaning out of your work to help you push when times get tough.\\n\\n5. An Overnight Success Never Happens Overnight\\n\\nIt took me 9 months and 30 videos until I finally had a video take off, and although the success may have seemed to be from a single video, the real reason came from what I learned in those previous 9 months. Even when something seems like an \"overnight success\" it is normally from a lot of effort that nobody sees.\\n\\n6. The Biggest Risk In Life Is Not Taking One\\n\\nIn life, we often question things that are good for us like taking a chance to do something we are passionate about and think of everything that can go wrong; however, we don\\'t question the risks of staying where we are. I believe that the biggest risk in life is not taking one and to push past the fear and give your dreams a shot.\\n\\n7. Freedom Isn’t Going To Meet You Halfway, You Have To Chase It Everyday\\n\\nThere is often this glamorized image of quitting your job that the second you leave, thing will start changing; however, this is not true. In order to have freedom in your life, you have to actively chase it every day. Freedom is not definite, so you can not take it for granted. It is something you have to embrace as hard as you can for as long as you have it. \\n\\n8. Success Isn’t Owned. It’s Rented, And Rent Is Due Everyday\\n\\nI used to think that once you had success in life, things would start coming easier, but this is not true. Success is not definite. Once you have success in life, it does not mean that you\\'re going to continue having success. Success is something you have to fight for every day or you will lose it. \\n\\n9. Success Is Just Failure\\n\\nSuccessful people are people who fail the most; however, instead of giving up, they learn from their failures and move forward. Most of the time when you pursue success, you are going to fail, but eventually after so much failing, you will have some success. And then success will go away because it isn\\'t permanent. \\n\\n10. Everyone Should Take A Chance At Least Once In Their Life\\n\\nI took a chance with this channel to do something different and pursue something I am passionate about. This experience has changed me so much as a person and I continue to grow every day as I am constantly challenged. I believe that everyone should take a chance at least once in their lives to do something crazy!!\\n\\n\\n** Links above are affiliate links where if you click and order, I will receive a commission at no cost to you. **', 'In this video I share more about what is going on in my life, why I quit my corporate job and what I am going to do next.  #greatresignation #quittingmyjob \\n\\nConnect With Me:\\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/totallymeagan/\\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@totallymeagan?lang=en\\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/totallymeagan\\n\\n\\nOther links: \\n- My Amazon Favorites: https://www.amazon.com/shop/totallymeagan\\n- If you want to try an Amazon Prime 30-Day Free trial - https://amzn.to/385mNCz\\n\\n\\nFor Business Inquiries, please contact me at: itsmeaganmiller@gmail.com \\n\\n\\nVideo Details:\\nCamera: Sony ZV-1 \\nSoftware: Final Cut Pro\\n\\n\\n~ Disclaimer: Some of the links above are affiliate links and I will be paid a small percentage!!

The trend of employees choosing to not go above and beyond their jobs in ways that include refusing to answer emails during evenings or weekends, or skipping extra assignments that fall outside their core duties, is catching on, especially among Gen Zers.\\n\\nZaid Khan, 24, an engineer from New York, popularized this trend with his viral Tiktok video in July.\\n\\n\"You are still performing your duties, but you are no longer subscribing to the hustle culture mentally that work has to be our life,\" Khan says in his video. \"The reality is, it\\'s not, and your worth as a person is not defined by your labor.\"\\n\\nIn the U.S., quiet quitting could also be a backlash to so-called hustle culture — the 24/7 startup grind popularized by figures like Gary Vaynerchuk and others.\\n\\n\"Quiet quitting is an antidote to hustle culture,\" said Nadia De Ala, founder of Real You Leadership, who \"quietly quit\" her job about five years ago. \"It is almost direct resistance and disruption of hustle culture. And I think it\\'s exciting that more people are doing it.\"\\n\\nLast year, the Great Resignation dominated the economic news cycle. Now, during the second half of 2022, it\\'s the quiet quitting trend that\\'s gaining momentum at a time when the rate of U.S. productivity is raising some concern. Data on U.S. worker productivity posted its biggest annual drop in the second quarter.\\n\\nSo, why is this trend on the rise? Watch the video above to learn whether quiet quitting is hurting the U.S. economy and how it\\'s being seen as part of the Great Resignation narrative.\\n\\n» Subscribe to CNBC:\\xa0https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV:\\xa0https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\\n\\nAbout CNBC: From \\'Wall Street\\' to \\'Main Street\\' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

Welcome to this day in my life vlog--most of it ended up being me chatting about burn out, quitting my job and what it\\'s been like becoming self employed. I worked in marketing for 2.5 years, and over the course of that time really burnt myself out. I\\'m now working a job (\"job\" feels like the wrong word. I\\'m not doing work) that feels properly fulfilling and makes me happy. And I couldn\\'t be more thankful or grateful to you guys for all of your support. You are the reason I\\'ve been able to make this jump, so thank you 💛\\n\\nI hope you enjoy the video! Take care 💛💛\\n\\nEquipment I use:\\n*Main camera: https://amzn.to/3gnhQKA\\n*Main lens: https://amzn.to/3vbRIaU\\n*Vlogging camera: https://amzn.to/3iwfWdk\\n*Microphone: https://amzn.to/35aTTkq\\n*Tripod: https://amzn.to/3vqWSA9\\n\\n*Get the Japan Rail Pass: https://click.jrpass.com/aff_c?offer_id=21&aff_id=509\\n\\nMusic // \\nhttps://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/tryfxh/\\n\\nLinks marked with * are affiliate links 🌼', 'I decided to quit my job and this is why...', 'PLEASE READ: I quit my job 1 year ago, and this video is about how and why I did that. I had been asking myself “should I quit my job” for a while, but it took some time before I was able to get everything in place so that I felt comfortable enough to take that risk of quitting my job.\\n\\nWhat I did not mention in this video and I want to make clear is that not everyone should do what I did. There is no question that luck played a role in any sort of success that my YouTube channel had in 2022, and even though I hope that success continues in 2023 and beyond - nothing is guaranteed. Having a steady and reliable salary is very important to most people, and the only 2 reasons that I felt comfortable enough to quit my job was because I saved up several months of cash, and I also had this YouTube income that was growing. I had felt like quitting my job many times before, but without those 2 things I could not take that risk of quitting without any money to support myself.\\n\\nI also recognize that not everyone wants to have their own YouTube channel or their own business and that is completely fine! You can still take steps to quit your job if it’s not a job that you want to be doing; but instead of starting a business, you could be networking to find a new job instead. \\n\\nNow that I rely on myself entirely for my income, it can get stressful at times because I have to work hard or I might not make any money. Overall, I personally love that feeling - but not everyone will. I want to grow this channel and this business even more in 2023, and the thought of doing that it is 100x more fulfilling than any other 9-5 job that I’ve had before.\\n\\nThis video is also not meant to say that I would never work for a company again because like I said, I really enjoyed a lot of things about my first job! But quitting was a way for me to reset my career and pursue something that I was very passionate about. This also might be the only time in my life that I can take a risk like this, so I have zero regrets. In the future, I probably will work for someone else again if the opportunity is right for me. But I want to earn enough money right now while saving and investing so that I can make my career moves on my own terms.\\n\\nSo hopefully this video of me talking about how I quit my job is useful to anyone that watches it. If anyone is looking to do something similar, just make sure you understand the risks and set yourself up ahead of time to minimize those risks. Think long term and be patient! Thank you all for an amazing 2022 and letting me create the content that I love to make!\\n\\n-Daniel\\n\\n\\n--- 💳 My Best Credit Cards: https://danielbraun.me/BestCreditCards  \\n\\n\\n--- 📈 Up To 15 Free Stocks With Moomoo: https://danielbraun.me/moomoo \\n\\n\\nJoin The Credit Community Discord: https://danielbraun.me/TheCreditCommunity \\nFOLLOW ME on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/_danbraun/ \\n\\n\\nCHECK OUT SOME OF MY OTHER VIDEOS:\\n\\nHow I Save 60% My Income (My Budgeting Method): https://youtu.be/8CTvAvA8iq4 \\nHow I Make $16,550 Per Month (5 Income Sources): https://youtu.be/N3wX-NywSw8 \\nThe 14 Credit Cards I Have At Age 27 (My Journey): https://youtu.be/rorEAQoT3IM \\nDo THIS For An 800 Credit Score (5 Steps): https://youtu.be/UTZGWuHbmu8 \\n10 Ways To Save $10,000 FAST: https://youtu.be/U1cUPRr4nvk \\nHow To Climb The Credit Card Ladder (Explained): https://youtu.be/1KswO3lvG8c \\n\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: Some of the card links and other products that appear on this website are from companies which Daniel Braun will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Personally, the biggest change in my career and life started in 2010 when I quit my job to pursue a lifestyle more congruent to my values and own design.\\n\\nIt’s been 12 years since I left my job, and I have no regrets about that decision. In fact, my life has become richer and fuller, and I wouldn’t change anything about it.\\n\\nPerhaps some people would think it’s a reckless idea to quit a job since I am a solo parent with a child who goes to school, a mortgage to pay, and several other expenses that need a steady income to cover them all.\\n\\nBut I did not just walk away from my job. I had an escape plan and a clear strategy to set the wheels in motion.\\n\\nMy reason for quitting my job was plain and simple - it was killing my soul. I enjoyed teaching but it’s the other things about my job that sucked the life out of me. I had almost no weekends, I was not present for my son for most of the day, and I was extremely tired each time I got home. I was surviving but most definitely not thriving.\\n\\nI thought hard and long about what I was experiencing and asked myself - do I really want to be in this situation for another 10, 20, 30 years or so?\\n\\nIn my heart, I wanted a career that would allow me to work at my own preferred time, one that would give me the freedom to declare a holiday for myself when I needed or wanted to, to be present for my son, to live anywhere I wanted and not tied up to a location I disliked just because it’s close to my workplace.\\n\\nBack in 2010, remote work was not very popular. But I had my big break in 2009 when I got a side job to author and publish a school textbook, which paid me more than 3 months of working as a teacher. And the best thing about it - I got to do what I really wanted - to work at the comfort of my own home, sometimes even at a cafe or a park, as long as I had my laptop with me.\\n\\nBut I did not just walk over to my superiors at school one day with a resignation letter in hand. Several months before I quit my job, I was working on developing certain skills that would equip me better for remote work. \\n\\nFast-forward to this day, I am glad I took that risk of stepping into the unknown and pursuing a career that fits the kind of lifestyle I wanted . Most of all, I appreciate having the financial, location, and time freedom as a freelancer. I have a more flexible schedule, shorter work hours if I want to, and a better work-life balance.\\n\\nI also created a weekly routine that is less stressful to simplify my day, which I will talk more about in my next video.\\n\\nI did not know all of these things were possible before I quit my job. I was afraid to take the risk because I thought there’s permanent security by staying where I was since I had payments, loans, and a mortgage to pay. Yet, I was clearly miserable and wanted the day to end even before it started.\\n\\nSo I figured if I was miserable in my job and did not change anything in 5 or 10 years, I would be much more miserable, depressed, and a lot older. \\n\\nI pursued a lifestyle that I found to be meaningful, and the first step was switching to a career that allowed me to make it happen. \\n\\nPersonally, practicing minimalism, and living a simple and intentional life continue to help me to keep my priorities in check. By living simply, I don’t need to take on many projects and earn more money at the expense of my time, health, and happiness. I make enough from what I do, have some saved, then only buying and consuming things that I need.

Not knowing if what you're doing is really the right thing is even worse. In my opinion, success is unattainable. Its a subjective term. But what IS attainable is waking up each morning with purpose and trying to be a better version of yourself today than you were yesterday. I realized everything that has happened in my life, whether camera related or not, has led up to present day of me wanting to chase my passion as a filmmaker/videographer. So even though you might not be where you want to in life, each day can be a chance for you to take a step in the right direction. Even if its a small one. Hope my story can serve as proof that its okay to not have it figured out. Its okay to not be working your dream job yet. Its okay to be in college. Its okay to not have money right now. Its okay to be nervous. Its okay to be sad once in a while. But WHATS NOT OKAY is giving up. So keep pushing.

I did not want to be a guy just sitting around talking about doing cool stuff. \\n\\nBesides after working as an engineer for big companies for 15 years I was pretty much done helping others achieve their dream. \\n\\nThe scariest thing was to say goodbye to the security of the monthly paycheck. It felt like I cut my lifeline. \\n\\nBut something cool happens as we make scary decisions that eventually change our lives. We adapt, and make the most of it. Thats a great thing about being a creative. \\n\\nIm not rich to be able to do this, but with a little passive income trickling in each month from passive income, a few freelance gigs here and there and a few bucks from this youtube channel it is now slowly building up to be a decent living. \\n\\nYou can do this way faster than I did, as I mentioned in the video, I was enjoying myself a bit too much for a few years before noticing my funds were getting low. \\n\\nI wish I did several things differently to capitalize on the full time travel life, but we are all so smart in retrospect, arent we? Besides, I have some great memories, and now im at it full speed. \\n\\nNever too late. That goes for you as well, if youre reading this and you want to do something cool for yourself.

If you are an injured worker with a California injury, and don’t have an attorney, this video is intended to help provide an overview of workers’ compensation topics so you can better represent yourself. \\n\\nMany injured workers want to quit there job, but worry about how it will impact the workers' comp case. If you quit the job you had when you got injured, your workers' comp case will keep going. You'll keep seeing doctors and eventually settle.  But quitting can impact your temporary disability, and it could impact your job voucher. \\n\\nJeremy Lusk is a certified specialist in workers’ compensation with almost two decades of experience, and previously served as a Judge at the Fresno District Office of the WCAB.

This video is not offering legal advice as to what you should, or should not, do in your workers’ compensation case, but rather offers education/information as to the California workers’ compensation system for unrepresented workers so they can  better represent themselves and make more informed decisions. \\n\\nIf you have any questions, let us know at questions@mywcguide.com\", 'How Do I Quite My Job The Right Way? \\nMake your dream job a REALITY!

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)', 'OMG I quit my job!

While I was modeling in Hong Kong, I eventually felt the desire to further my education. I decided to depart the modeling world and move back to Canada, knowing that could be the end of my modeling opportunities. I attended Ryerson University for GCM (Graphic Communications Management), as I thought I might still work in the fashion industry in another capacity. It was in my last year of university, I was introduced to a very basic coding course. I instantly fell in love. From there I knew I wanted to pursue software development but didn't have a clue where to start. I didn't want to go back to university as I just completed a four-year degree. I decided to enroll in a 10-week intensive coding Bootcamp. From there I started working at a small startup learning and growing my technical and soft skills. I then transitioned to a larger company where I am a software developer and technical consultant today.\\n\\n\\nI QUIT my Software Development Job | Why I left and what's next\\n#I_QUIT_my_Software_Development_Job #tiffintech\", \"Hello my chicken nuggets!

And those clear signs as well as a strong gut feeling I was better quitting job without backup plan than struggling through it was why I left hairdressing and why I quit my career.\\n\\nQuitting a job without plan b definitely wasn't easy and I had a lot of changing careers anxiety about it. In this video I want to share with you why I quit my job as a hairdresser, how I quit my job without a plan b and how to decide if it's time to change jobs. But just because this is how I decided to give up my career, doesn't mean it's necessarily good reason for you to do the same. Everyone's situation is different and if you're thinking about leaving job with no plan, it might give you more to think about and help you come to a decision for yourself.

It estimates your quarterly taxes and keeps track of your tax write-off for miles that you drive doing food delivery.

Know your worth.', \"A former asylum officer says “remain in Mexico” and other policies undermining asylum aren’t just racist, they’re illegal.\\n\\nIn the Video Op-Ed above, a former asylum officer reveals why he resigned: to protest President Trump’s policy requiring migrants to remain in Mexico while awaiting hearings. \\n\\nDoug Stephens had been an asylum officer for two years. But two days and five interviews that resulted in  sending asylum seekers back to danger shook him. He drafted a memo detailing his legal objections to the policy, and circulated it to 80 of his colleagues, his supervisors and a member of Congress. And then he quit.\\n\\nMr. Stephens is not the only asylum officer who has grappled with following orders. In interviews with a half-dozen current and former asylum officers across the country, The Times learned of individuals leaving their posts, requesting job transfers and falling into deep depression. \\n\\nThe right to asylum has been a cornerstone of international immigration law since the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The United States, along with 144 other nations, made a commitment to protect those who arrive at our borders with “a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.” \\n\\nTo date, Mr. Trump’s remain in Mexico policy, officially known as one of the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” has left nearly 58,000 asylum seekers stranded in Mexico. \\n\\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n\\nMore from The New York Times Video:  http://nytimes.com/video\\n----------\\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.

Deciding to quit my job was a long process and there were a LOT of times I thought maybe I shouldn't quit and just stay where I was. \\n\\nBut if there are clear signs it's time to leave your job, eventually it gets hard to ignore them. And those clear signs as well as a strong gut feeling I was better quitting job without backup plan than struggling through it was why I left hairdressing and why I quit my career.\\n\\nQuitting a job without plan b definitely wasn't easy and I had a lot of changing careers anxiety about it. In this video I want to share with you why I quit my job as a hairdresser, how I quit my job without a plan b and how to decide if it's time to change jobs. But just because this is how I decided to give up my career, doesn't mean it's necessarily good reason for you to do the same. Everyone's situation is different and if you're thinking about leaving job with no plan, it might give you more to think about and help you come to a decision for yourself.

Being and airline captain is the dream job of many, but the dream& reality don't always align.

Since leaving BA I’ve been employed by another airline, but haven’t flown a single flight. My current job is a fixed term contract and is my stepping stone to a new career. Leaving BA, one of the most stable jobs in the industry to go contracting is a big change & only time will tell if it was the correct change. \\n\\nYou’ll see in any subsequent videos I clearly state my employment status but in this first video it appears the message wasn’t conveyed as much as some would have liked. (The lengths a hater will go to is amusing)\\n\\nI thought maybe 50 people would watch this very rough round the edges video, so I’ll admit the quality isn’t what I’d have liked! \\n\\nI spent 6 years at British Airways and it simply wasn't for me. Flying people around Europe no longer interested me and I needed a new challenge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChanging careers is tough, there are many challenges and everyone likes to share their opinions of your decision.\\nStuff I Use To Make These Videos\\n— Camera & Lenses —\\nCanon M50: https://amzn.to/2WsQic1\\nCanon EF-M 22mm f/2.0 : https://amzn.to/2Se4mH7\\n\\n— Camera Kit —\\nNew Camera Microphone: https://amzn.to/2Sh0Hs4\\nTravel Microphone: https://amzn.to/2MInBmO\\n\\nDouble Cold Show Mount: https://amzn.to/2MJgwCx\\nAwesome Camera Light: https://amzn.to/2MKVSSv\\nLightweight & Compact 55” tripod: https://amzn.to/2Sh0WDu\\n\\nLacie USB-C rugged drive: https://amzn.to/2DNPcQE\\nCADeN Camera & Travel backpack: https://amzn.to/2WuyUDP\\n\\n— GoPro Accessories —\\nND Filter Set: https://amzn.to/2WARAl0\\nBackpack Strap Mount: https://amzn.to/2TnXpAl\\nBackup Batteries & Charger: https://amzn.to/2SihJ8V\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: This video and description contain affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, Career Ending Opportunities may receive a small commission.

A disclaimer I\\'d like to add: this is my journey with my individual views, ups, and downs. I am not speaking on behalf of or against any organization. I have due regard for both my ex-employers.\\n\\nThis is the truth of my life and I have experienced some hardships I\\'d want someone to take inspiration from. It is okay to graduate after doing an MBA from an IIM and not knowing what is your true calling. It is okay to pursue your passion for a while to see if that\\'s what you would want to do. It is okay quitting a role that you don\\'t see yourself pursuing in the long run. It is okay to quit a mainstream career to do something you enjoy.\\n\\nIf you have faced mental health issues in the past, I just want you to know it\\'s possible to come out of that hard time by taking professional help, please do consult with a good therapist if needed, it did wonders to my recovery.\\n\\nI have quit my job to pursue content creation full-time. I quit my job for YouTube, I am here to solve your problems - they could be exam-related, job-related, or even self-improvement-related. Having been through a tough journey, I can help you come out of a bad phase in life, I can at least try knowing what worked for me.\\n\\nThese are just a few points I want to put across through this video.

My family and I have been Disney World Annual Passholders for about 10 years. We love making memories together in our happy place. I have always loved documenting our trips through photos and in 2014 I felt inspired to capture our memories in an even more in-depth way. I picked up the camera and discovered a pure passion for vlogging! I love getting to capture my travels, cherished times and fun moments! I enjoy getting to relive these moments while I edit the videos and love having these memories documented to look back on. I have discovered such a rewarding love from the feeling I get through sharing my vlogs here on YouTube! I love meeting people here in our online community who share the same interests as I do! We all get to connect over our mutual love of all things Disney and travel! \\nI have visited all of the Disney Parks in the United States: Disneyland, California Adventure, Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom! It is my dream to one day visited all the international Disney Parks as well! My travel interests also go beyond the Disney Parks, I love vlogging my cruise vacations and trips to all-inclusive resorts! \\nI am from Pennsylvania and grew up in a small town outside of Philadelphia. My dream is to soon relocate to the Orlando area and live near Disney! \\nSubscribe to join me on my journeys with travel vlogs, lifestyle vlogs, DIY videos and everything in between!     \\n\\nHave a Magical Day!\\nGod Bless!\\n- Magical Meg', 'Starting now I am a professional CSGO Trader!

Quitting my nursing career was a huge challenge. I went through an identity crisis. \\n\\n\"Am I really quitting nursing for another career?\" I put 7 years into the vocation and this was a tough pill to swallow. And at the time I didn\\'t really know why I quit my nursing career...until I fully healed. \\n\\nThen I realized there was a huge misalignment for me. \\n\\nIf you are thinking about leaving nursing field, you are not alone. There are many people thinking about leaving nursing after 2 years. People are sick of feeling taken for granted and giving their all for institutions.

However, being too afraid to charge what your services are worth can actually hurt your potential profits in the long run.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons why undercharging can be detrimental to your business is that it can make your services seem less valuable. Customers may assume your prices are lower than your competitors, then the quality of your services must also be lower. This can lead to a perception of your business as less professional or less skilled, and ultimately make it harder for you to attract and retain customers.\\n\\nSo, what can you do to ensure that you're charging what your services are worth?\\nOne solution is to use an app like Quote IQ to help you manage your business. Quote IQ is a powerful tool that can help you create professional-looking quotes and invoices, track your time and expenses, and get a better sense of your profitability.\\n\\nWith Quote IQ, you can easily set your prices based on your costs, your level of\\nexpertise, and the value that you bring to your customers. You can also experiment with different pricing models to see what works best for vour business. For\\nexample, you might consider offering different tiers of services at different price\\npoints, or offering a discount for customers who sign up for a long-term contract.\\n\\n#pressurewashing #business #satisfying\", 'This video is the story of my transition from a high school maths teacher to a business owner, watch how I did it.\\n\\n\\n\\n#business #businessowner #highschoolteacher #mathematics #money', 'I Quit my Job | Prank on wife \\u200b\\u2060gone wrong | Aishna Narwal \\n\\n#divorceprank #cheatingprank  #pranks \\n\\nHello friends welcome back to my channel Aishna narwal 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰\\n\\nIn this hilarious video, I decided to pull the ultimate job quitting prank on my unsuspecting wife.

Quit your 9 to 5 job to get rich. Quit the rat race and become financially independent.\" You might have heard this multiple times in financial videos and advertisements. These videos and many financial influencers have created a belief among working-class people that they are doing a mistake by going for a regular job.

I\\'m Jonathan Montoya, and I\\'m excited to tell you how the Affiliate Stacking Ecosystem helped me earn money and eventually quit my job within just 9 months. With this system, I promoted 40 different products like Legendary Marketer, Clickfunnels, Systeme io, Freedom Accelerator, Freedom Breakthrough, Tube Buddy, and GetResponse.\\n\\nSo, here\\'s how it worked. I used email marketing to reach out to people who were interested in what I had to offer. By building a list of these interested individuals, I could send them personalized emails based on their specific interests. That way, I made sure to recommend products that matched their needs and preferences.\\n\\nAs I shared valuable content and honest recommendations, people started to trust me more. They saw me as someone who genuinely wanted to help them. Because of this trust, they were more likely to engage with my promotions and purchase the products I recommended. This increased the amount of money I earned from my online business.\\n\\nAfter just 9 months of implementing the Affiliate Stacking Ecosystem, my online business had grown so much that I was able to leave my job and focus on my business full-time. The income I was generating from promoting various products allowed me to support myself without relying on a traditional job.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to achieve similar success and have the freedom to pursue your dreams, I strongly encourage you to try the Affiliate Stacking Ecosystem. It\\'s a system that can help you build a thriving online business and change your life.\\n\\nLet\\'s embark on this exciting journey together and make your dreams a reality using the power of the Affiliate Stacking Ecosystem!\"\\n\\n=========================================\\nKEY MOMENTS IN THIS EPISODE\\n=========================================\\n00:00 What is the Affiliate Stacking Ecosytem\\n00:30 Promoting Multiple Affiliate Programs At Once\\n01:10 The Right way to Promote Affiliate Products\\n01:44 The Affiliate Stacking Ecosystem Explanation\\n02:14 What is the MAIN CORE offer in affiliate Marketing\\n02:37 How to Find Your Customer Avatar in Affilaite Marketing\\n04:57 Finding Multiple Affiliate Products to Promote\\n05:19 What is Affiiate Marketing and How does it work?\\n05:47 How Freedom Accelerator Works\\n06:18 Best Softwares to Promote as an Affiliate Marketer\\n07:02 Clone Jonathan Montoya\\'s Affiliate Stacking Ecosytem\\n07:30 How Does Email Followup work for Affiliate Marketing\\n08:46 How to Use a lead magnet to make affiliate income\\n09:15 Best Funnel for Affiliate Marketers\\n10:00 How to do Email email the correct way for affiliate marketing\\n12:05 Promote Multiple Affiliate Products at once\\n12:55 How to Grow a YouTube Channel With the Affiliate Stacking Ecosytem\\n13:28 How the Affiliate Stacking Ecosystem Makes Money\\n14:00 What is the 72 Hour Challenge?\\n\\n=========================================\\nWHAT TO WATCH NEXT\\n=========================================\\n[VIDEO] Make $100/Day By Sending an Email (How to Build An Email List)\\nhttps://youtu.be/Xerb4iU_6Hg\\n\\n[VIDEO] How to Generate an Extra $5,000 a Month Through Affiliate Marketing\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11lZiaceOxU\\n\\n[PLAYLIST] Free Affiliate Marketing Course\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyOYf6C6bZU&list=PLxdVtsk5SqGprYly4bVyEpMB1H1hUvQSl\\n\\n[PLAYLIST] How To Start Affiliate Marketing as A Complete Beginner\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxdVtsk5SqGq90Md3vG-RPNb0eFn6pjqy\\n\\nDISCLAIMER\\n=========================================\\nThis video and description may contain affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, I’ll receive a small commission.

Both of my day jobs were awesome!

This was one of the hardest periods of my life. I couldn\\'t show many clips due to the length of the video. But I had more and more clips that portray how difficult this period was on me. I didn\\'t want to burden you and felt it wasn\\'t relevant to the story, but certainly there were more heartbreaks.\\n\\nThis was also one of the best periods of my life in terms of preparing my character to what was coming next. Not breaking with all this pressure lead me to become a much stronger individual with a more stoic demeanor. I just need to get my sense of humor back and it will be all good.\\n\\nI am happy this is finally out, I have had it in my heart for a while. \\nI hope that if you are in the dark period right now to remember \"not to give up\".

Kamal essays the role of a professional stuntman, who religiously believes in remaining bachelor and Simran palys a self sufficient, feministic, men-hating doctor. They are invariably forced to bump into each other by their mutual friends Abbas and Sneha. Both help Abbas and Sneha to elope and get married. But finally Abbas misses his opportunity to go to Australia. So he finds his wife Sneha leaving him, in charge of the household chores. A frustrated Abbas goes to his friend Kamal for help to get back his upper hand over his wife. While Simran counsels Sneha not to submit to the authority of her husband. As both Sneha and Abbas are being brainwashed by their respective friends, it leads to a string of comic incidents.In one such event, Kamal who is a stunt master meets with an accident during a shooting scene. Simran being a doctor operates on Kamal, but commits the blunder of sewing her watch inside Kamal during the operation. With her profession and reputation at stake, she finds it difficult to pin Kamal down to the operation table and re-operate him. So she decides to play as the love-struck damsel and finally fetches the watch back out of Kamal. But Kamal who by now is smitten by Simran, is completely shattered when he learns about the truth. So he finally agrees to marry the girl his parents have arranged even as Simran is reflecting on her feelings for Kamal. Kamal excels in his role --as always. But Simran proves with her performance that she has more to offer than just being a glamorous heroine and deserves a definite applause. With this kind of a setting there is enough room for Mouli the director and script writer Crazy Mohan to set the ball rolling so fast that you have to be quick to assimilate all humor between the lines too.', '自駕武隆仙女山，沒想到在重慶也有大草原，綠油油的太養眼了\\n自駕武隆仙女山，5A景區平均海拔1900米，被譽為“東方瑞士”【大海去旅行】\\n订阅链接👉👉👉https://dahai.page.link/01\\n\\n去哪不重要，重要的是去！\\n\\n大家好，我是大海，辞去工作奔向诗和远方。\\n如果你想了解中国，了解中国的各个城市，敬请关注，带你领略城市的风采\\n#旅行#武隆仙女山#自駕#重庆', 'We spent the day on Melrose giving an extra hand with our friends at The Cool.

I started YouTube a year and a half ago at an extremely slow pace, posting videos for about 9 months until I finally had 1 video that took the channel off. Shortly after seeing a potential in the channel, I decided to go all in and quit my job about 7 months ago. In this video, I reflect on this journey and share, \"10 Life Lessons I\\'ve Learned Since Starting YouTube.\"\\n\\n1. Never Stop Dreaming\\n\\nThe reason I originally started this channel was because I was unhappy with the direction my life was going and wanted the next great adventure in life. My job left me in this routine of doing similar things every day and due to having a high pay, I noticed that it scared me away from dreaming in life. I believe it is important to prioritize dreaming in your life and never stop dreaming no matter how old you get. \\n\\n2. You Don’t Need To Know What You’re Doing, You Just Need To Start\\n\\nOftentimes, we think that before we do something we need to know everything about it; however, regardless of whatever you do, in the beginning, you are going to suck at it. When you first start something you lack experience and expertise; however, you should never let that prevent you from starting. It is important to just take the first step and you can learn as you go.\\n\\n3. The Universe Is Conspiring In Your Favor, Even Though You May Not Understand How\\n\\nMany people will give up early in the process of pursuing their dreams because they think that \"it just wasn\\'t meant to be.\" Whatever you choose to do in life, you need hope and faith to keep moving. You need to believe in yourself and your abilities despite all odds. And as you continue on your journey, if you work hard and put in the effort, the universe will eventually cut you some slack.\\n\\n4. It Can’t Just Be About Money\\n\\nWhatever you want to do in life, there has to be some reason other than money. If money is your only reason of being you will either quickly give up or will feel empty about the work you are doing. It is important to find enjoyment or meaning out of your work to help you push when times get tough.\\n\\n5. An Overnight Success Never Happens Overnight\\n\\nIt took me 9 months and 30 videos until I finally had a video take off, and although the success may have seemed to be from a single video, the real reason came from what I learned in those previous 9 months. Even when something seems like an \"overnight success\" it is normally from a lot of effort that nobody sees.\\n\\n6. The Biggest Risk In Life Is Not Taking One\\n\\nIn life, we often question things that are good for us like taking a chance to do something we are passionate about and think of everything that can go wrong; however, we don\\'t question the risks of staying where we are. I believe that the biggest risk in life is not taking one and to push past the fear and give your dreams a shot.\\n\\n7. Freedom Isn’t Going To Meet You Halfway, You Have To Chase It Everyday\\n\\nThere is often this glamorized image of quitting your job that the second you leave, thing will start changing; however, this is not true. In order to have freedom in your life, you have to actively chase it every day. Freedom is not definite, so you can not take it for granted. It is something you have to embrace as hard as you can for as long as you have it. \\n\\n8. Success Isn’t Owned. It’s Rented, And Rent Is Due Everyday\\n\\nI used to think that once you had success in life, things would start coming easier, but this is not true. Success is not definite. Once you have success in life, it does not mean that you\\'re going to continue having success. Success is something you have to fight for every day or you will lose it. \\n\\n9. Success Is Just Failure\\n\\nSuccessful people are people who fail the most; however, instead of giving up, they learn from their failures and move forward. Most of the time when you pursue success, you are going to fail, but eventually after so much failing, you will have some success. And then success will go away because it isn\\'t permanent. \\n\\n10. Everyone Should Take A Chance At Least Once In Their Life\\n\\nI took a chance with this channel to do something different and pursue something I am passionate about. This experience has changed me so much as a person and I continue to grow every day as I am constantly challenged. I believe that everyone should take a chance at least once in their lives to do something crazy!!\\n\\n\\n** Links above are affiliate links where if you click and order, I will receive a commission at no cost to you. **', 'In this video I share more about what is going on in my life, why I quit my corporate job and what I am going to do next.  #greatresignation #quittingmyjob \\n\\nConnect With Me:\\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/totallymeagan/\\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@totallymeagan?lang=en\\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/totallymeagan\\n\\n\\nOther links: \\n- My Amazon Favorites: https://www.amazon.com/shop/totallymeagan\\n- If you want to try an Amazon Prime 30-Day Free trial - https://amzn.to/385mNCz\\n\\n\\nFor Business Inquiries, please contact me at: itsmeaganmiller@gmail.com \\n\\n\\nVideo Details:\\nCamera: Sony ZV-1 \\nSoftware: Final Cut Pro\\n\\n\\n~ Disclaimer: Some of the links above are affiliate links and I will be paid a small percentage!!

The trend of employees choosing to not go above and beyond their jobs in ways that include refusing to answer emails during evenings or weekends, or skipping extra assignments that fall outside their core duties, is catching on, especially among Gen Zers.\\n\\nZaid Khan, 24, an engineer from New York, popularized this trend with his viral Tiktok video in July.\\n\\n\"You are still performing your duties, but you are no longer subscribing to the hustle culture mentally that work has to be our life,\" Khan says in his video. \"The reality is, it\\'s not, and your worth as a person is not defined by your labor.\"\\n\\nIn the U.S., quiet quitting could also be a backlash to so-called hustle culture — the 24/7 startup grind popularized by figures like Gary Vaynerchuk and others.\\n\\n\"Quiet quitting is an antidote to hustle culture,\" said Nadia De Ala, founder of Real You Leadership, who \"quietly quit\" her job about five years ago. \"It is almost direct resistance and disruption of hustle culture. And I think it\\'s exciting that more people are doing it.\"\\n\\nLast year, the Great Resignation dominated the economic news cycle. Now, during the second half of 2022, it\\'s the quiet quitting trend that\\'s gaining momentum at a time when the rate of U.S. productivity is raising some concern. Data on U.S. worker productivity posted its biggest annual drop in the second quarter.\\n\\nSo, why is this trend on the rise?

Applying for job after job and not getting any interviews?   Perhaps you’ve got a few interviews but always seem to get passed over for the job?   Or maybe you’re not satisfied with your current career and want a change.  Well, you’ve come to the right place.   \\n \\nAs a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience hiring thousands of employees at all levels into major corporations, I’m going to spill the beans on how to get noticed by recruiters, start getting more interviews, navigate through each step of the hiring process, and ultimately land the dream job you deserve.   \\n \\nBut that’s not all - I firmly believe that to truly experience career success, you need to think bigger.   Multiple streams of income and budgeting are crucial to forming a layoff-free lifestyle and helping you achieve your goals.    \\n \\nIf these are things you’re struggling with, that’s what I specialize in.   I’ve got a website called A Life After Layoff.   It’s loaded with tips and tricks for getting noticed, interviewed, and hired by your dream company.    Make sure you check it out!   \\n \\nI’ve got weekly videos coming at you, so make sure to subscribe.   You won’t want to miss a post.

I had been asking myself “should I quit my job” for a while, but it took some time before I was able to get everything in place so that I felt comfortable enough to take that risk of quitting my job.\\n\\nWhat I did not mention in this video and I want to make clear is that not everyone should do what I did. There is no question that luck played a role in any sort of success that my YouTube channel had in 2022, and even though I hope that success continues in 2023 and beyond - nothing is guaranteed. Having a steady and reliable salary is very important to most people, and the only 2 reasons that I felt comfortable enough to quit my job was because I saved up several months of cash, and I also had this YouTube income that was growing. I had felt like quitting my job many times before, but without those 2 things I could not take that risk of quitting without any money to support myself.\\n\\nI also recognize that not everyone wants to have their own YouTube channel or their own business and that is completely fine! You can still take steps to quit your job if it’s not a job that you want to be doing; but instead of starting a business, you could be networking to find a new job instead. \\n\\nNow that I rely on myself entirely for my income, it can get stressful at times because I have to work hard or I might not make any money. Overall, I personally love that feeling - but not everyone will. I want to grow this channel and this business even more in 2023, and the thought of doing that it is 100x more fulfilling than any other 9-5 job that I’ve had before.\\n\\nThis video is also not meant to say that I would never work for a company again because like I said, I really enjoyed a lot of things about my first job! But quitting was a way for me to reset my career and pursue something that I was very passionate about. This also might be the only time in my life that I can take a risk like this, so I have zero regrets. In the future, I probably will work for someone else again if the opportunity is right for me. But I want to earn enough money right now while saving and investing so that I can make my career moves on my own terms.\\n\\nSo hopefully this video of me talking about how I quit my job is useful to anyone that watches it. If anyone is looking to do something similar, just make sure you understand the risks and set yourself up ahead of time to minimize those risks. Think long term and be patient!

Personally, the biggest change in my career and life started in 2010 when I quit my job to pursue a lifestyle more congruent to my values and own design.\\n\\nIt’s been 12 years since I left my job, and I have no regrets about that decision. In fact, my life has become richer and fuller, and I wouldn’t change anything about it.\\n\\nPerhaps some people would think it’s a reckless idea to quit a job since I am a solo parent with a child who goes to school, a mortgage to pay, and several other expenses that need a steady income to cover them all.\\n\\nBut I did not just walk away from my job. I had an escape plan and a clear strategy to set the wheels in motion.\\n\\nMy reason for quitting my job was plain and simple - it was killing my soul. I enjoyed teaching but it’s the other things about my job that sucked the life out of me. I had almost no weekends, I was not present for my son for most of the day, and I was extremely tired each time I got home. I was surviving but most definitely not thriving.\\n\\nI thought hard and long about what I was experiencing and asked myself - do I really want to be in this situation for another 10, 20, 30 years or so?\\n\\nIn my heart, I wanted a career that would allow me to work at my own preferred time, one that would give me the freedom to declare a holiday for myself when I needed or wanted to, to be present for my son, to live anywhere I wanted and not tied up to a location I disliked just because it’s close to my workplace.\\n\\nBack in 2010, remote work was not very popular. But I had my big break in 2009 when I got a side job to author and publish a school textbook, which paid me more than 3 months of working as a teacher. And the best thing about it - I got to do what I really wanted - to work at the comfort of my own home, sometimes even at a cafe or a park, as long as I had my laptop with me.\\n\\nBut I did not just walk over to my superiors at school one day with a resignation letter in hand. Several months before I quit my job, I was working on developing certain skills that would equip me better for remote work. \\n\\nFast-forward to this day, I am glad I took that risk of stepping into the unknown and pursuing a career that fits the kind of lifestyle I wanted . Most of all, I appreciate having the financial, location, and time freedom as a freelancer. I have a more flexible schedule, shorter work hours if I want to, and a better work-life balance.\\n\\nI also created a weekly routine that is less stressful to simplify my day, which I will talk more about in my next video.\\n\\nI did not know all of these things were possible before I quit my job. I was afraid to take the risk because I thought there’s permanent security by staying where I was since I had payments, loans, and a mortgage to pay. Yet, I was clearly miserable and wanted the day to end even before it started.\\n\\nSo I figured if I was miserable in my job and did not change anything in 5 or 10 years, I would be much more miserable, depressed, and a lot older. \\n\\nI pursued a lifestyle that I found to be meaningful, and the first step was switching to a career that allowed me to make it happen. \\n\\nPersonally, practicing minimalism, and living a simple and intentional life continue to help me to keep my priorities in check. By living simply, I don’t need to take on many projects and earn more money at the expense of my time, health, and happiness. I make enough from what I do, have some saved, then only buying and consuming things that I need.  Quitting my job and living simply are some of the best decisions I have made in my life, and I am glad that I took this path.\\n\\nBut I am not here to give career advice. I’m merely sharing my thoughts on why I quit my job and where that decision has taken me. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, the choice is up to you. If you find meaning in your job, if you feel that it sparks joy in your soul, and you genuinely love it, then that’s what matters.', \"can't even believe i'm writing this but there is another side to burnout, and i think i see the tip of the iceberg of it. thanks for being here, thanks for being you.\\n\\ninstagram: @meganbatoon http://instagram.com/meganbatoon\\n\\nlike + subscribe here (it for real helps): http://bit.ly/Sub2MeganBatoon\\n\\nequipment i'm using:\\nsony a7iii: https://bit.ly/3pIyR5p\\nlens: https://bit.ly/2MM3vMK\\nmic setup: https://bit.ly/39F8iZh\\n\\n--------\\nEXCLUSIVE CONTENT (!!) : https://meganbatoon.substack.com/\\npodcast: Just a Tip http://bit.ly/JustATipPodcast\\nmerchandise: http://shop.meganbatoon.com\\ntweet me:  @meganbatoon\\nfacebook: http://facebook.com/MeganBatoonFP\\nmore on my website | http://www.meganbatoon.com\\n--------\\n\\n[I Quit My Job to Find Peace]\\n[https://youtu.be/LMk7gK893E0]\\n\\nMeganBatoon\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/MeganBatoon\\n\\nif you've read this far, comment we're getting there\", '***HEADPHONE USERS BEWARE***\\n\\nLeave a like if you enjoyed! :)\\n\\nCONNECT WITH ME!\\n\\nTwitch - http://www.twitch.tv/jevffa\\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/FaZeJev\\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/mrjeverson#\\n\\nCheck out TGN!\\nhttp://tgn.tv/', \"This is not a drill.

Not knowing if what you're doing is really the right thing is even worse. In my opinion, success is unattainable. Its a subjective term. But what IS attainable is waking up each morning with purpose and trying to be a better version of yourself today than you were yesterday. I realized everything that has happened in my life, whether camera related or not, has led up to present day of me wanting to chase my passion as a filmmaker/videographer. So even though you might not be where you want to in life, each day can be a chance for you to take a step in the right direction. Even if its a small one. Hope my story can serve as proof that its okay to not have it figured out. Its okay to not be working your dream job yet. Its okay to be in college. Its okay to not have money right now. Its okay to be nervous. Its okay to be sad once in a while. But WHATS NOT OKAY is giving up. So keep pushing.

While I was modeling in Hong Kong, I eventually felt the desire to further my education. I decided to depart the modeling world and move back to Canada, knowing that could be the end of my modeling opportunities. I attended Ryerson University for GCM (Graphic Communications Management), as I thought I might still work in the fashion industry in another capacity. It was in my last year of university, I was introduced to a very basic coding course. I instantly fell in love. From there I knew I wanted to pursue software development but didn't have a clue where to start. I didn't want to go back to university as I just completed a four-year degree. I decided to enroll in a 10-week intensive coding Bootcamp. From there I started working at a small startup learning and growing my technical and soft skills. I then transitioned to a larger company where I am a software developer and technical consultant today.\\n\\n\\nI QUIT my Software Development Job | Why I left and what's next\\n#I_QUIT_my_Software_Development_Job #tiffintech\", 'These are the Top 5 FUNNIEST Ways People Have Quit Their Jobs in Style. \\n\\nWe all have a job that we might not like from time to time, but these people stick it to the man when the quit their job in style.

You definitely need to prepare yourself, both mentally and financially.\\n\\nMany people were surprised (or even shocked) when I told them I'm taking a break from work and my career.\\n\\nThey just couldn't understand what on earth I will be doing with all the free time. \\n\\nThey also immediately projected their own fears onto me. That's okay, I get it.. because I experience those same fears and doubts.\\n\\nThe truth is, there's never a perfect time for a break. So I thought - why not in my 30s? Should I wait until my 40s? Or my 50s? Or even until my retirement? \\n\\nMy goal is to use my career break to learn new skills on growing food, sustainability, mindfulness, and slow living. \\n\\nLet the career break story begin! \\n\\nIf you would like to follow my journey of taking a career break from a 9-5 office job in 2021, you can subscribe to my channel.\\n\\n#careerbreak #careerbreakstories #adultgapyear #sabbatical #leavingninetofive #corporatelife #officelife #wellbeing #mindfulness #livingslow #nature #leavingcorporatejob #simplelife #breakfromwork\", \"The Great Resignation is here and everyone is quitting their jobs.

While I was modeling in Hong Kong, I eventually felt the desire to further my education. I decided to depart the modeling world and move back to Canada, knowing that could be the end of my modeling opportunities. I attended Ryerson University for GCM (Graphic Communications Management), as I thought I might still work in the fashion industry in another capacity. It was in my last year of university, I was introduced to a very basic coding course. I instantly fell in love. From there I knew I wanted to pursue software development but didn't have a clue where to start. I didn't want to go back to university as I just completed a four-year degree. I decided to enroll in a 10-week intensive coding Bootcamp. From there I started working at a small startup learning and growing my technical and soft skills. I then transitioned to a larger company where I am a software developer and technical consultant today.\\n\\n\\nI QUIT my Software Development Job | Why I left and what's next\\n#I_QUIT_my_Software_Development_Job #tiffintech\", 'When Should I Quit My Job That I Hate?\\nMake your dream job a REALITY!

It's a quest for fulfillment, instead of plugging into the system.\\n\\nIn 2020, I quit my job with no backup plan in pursuit of a larger long term goal. It wasn't something I'd intended to do at the time, but when things fall together in a way where your intuition is speaking to you, it's your responsibility to listen.

You definitely need to prepare yourself, both mentally and financially.\\n\\nMany people were surprised (or even shocked) when I told them I'm taking a break from work and my career.\\n\\nThey just couldn't understand what on earth I will be doing with all the free time. \\n\\nThey also immediately projected their own fears onto me. That's okay, I get it.. because I experience those same fears and doubts.\\n\\nThe truth is, there's never a perfect time for a break. So I thought - why not in my 30s? Should I wait until my 40s?

I have due regard for both my ex-employers.\\n\\nThis is the truth of my life and I have experienced some hardships I\\'d want someone to take inspiration from. It is okay to graduate after doing an MBA from an IIM and not knowing what is your true calling. It is okay to pursue your passion for a while to see if that\\'s what you would want to do. It is okay quitting a role that you don\\'t see yourself pursuing in the long run. It is okay to quit a mainstream career to do something you enjoy.\\n\\nIf you have faced mental health issues in the past, I just want you to know it\\'s possible to come out of that hard time by taking professional help, please do consult with a good therapist if needed, it did wonders to my recovery.\\n\\nI have quit my job to pursue content creation full-time. I quit my job for YouTube, I am here to solve your problems - they could be exam-related, job-related, or even self-improvement-related.

Being and airline captain is the dream job of many, but the dream& reality don't always align. I needed to change career and quitting my british airways pilot job was step 1.\\n\\nEDIT...\\nClarifying this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOU9z61rPKI\\nit’s been 4 months since I left BA and for some reason the YouTube algorithm has boosted my video. Since leaving BA I’ve been employed by another airline, but haven’t flown a single flight. My current job is a fixed term contract and is my stepping stone to a new career. Leaving BA, one of the most stable jobs in the industry to go contracting is a big change & only time will tell if it was the correct change. \\n\\nYou’ll see in any subsequent videos I clearly state my employment status but in this first video it appears the message wasn’t conveyed as much as some would have liked. (The lengths a hater will go to is amusing)\\n\\nI thought maybe 50 people would watch this very rough round the edges video, so I’ll admit the quality isn’t what I’d have liked! \\n\\nI spent 6 years at British Airways and it simply wasn't for me. Flying people around Europe no longer interested me and I needed a new challenge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChanging careers is tough, there are many challenges and everyone likes to share their opinions of your decision.\\nStuff I Use To Make These Videos\\n— Camera & Lenses —\\nCanon M50: https://amzn.to/2WsQic1\\nCanon EF-M 22mm f/2.0 : https://amzn.to/2Se4mH7\\n\\n— Camera Kit —\\nNew Camera Microphone: https://amzn.to/2Sh0Hs4\\nTravel Microphone: https://amzn.to/2MInBmO\\n\\nDouble Cold Show Mount: https://amzn.to/2MJgwCx\\nAwesome Camera Light: https://amzn.to/2MKVSSv\\nLightweight & Compact 55” tripod: https://amzn.to/2Sh0WDu\\n\\nLacie USB-C rugged drive: https://amzn.to/2DNPcQE\\nCADeN Camera & Travel backpack: https://amzn.to/2WuyUDP\\n\\n— GoPro Accessories —\\nND Filter Set: https://amzn.to/2WARAl0\\nBackpack Strap Mount: https://amzn.to/2TnXpAl\\nBackup Batteries & Charger: https://amzn.to/2SihJ8V\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: This video and description contain affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, Career Ending Opportunities may receive a small commission.

      "what's up everyone welcome to the video today i'm going to be talking about why i decided to quit my job without a backup plan i spent a lot of time wrestling with this decision before i determined what was best for me so i figured walking through my thought process might help you if you're considering leaving your job or making any big decision in life this is how the video will be structured there are time stamps in the description below and with that let's get right into it i've known forever that i wanted to be my own boss and that i didn't want to work a nine-to-five but i graduated college with a finance degree and like so many other people had a pile of student loan debt to repay and on top of that i didn't know what i wanted to do with my life and honestly i still don't so upon graduation i took a job with a big company doing corporate finance because it paid well it looked good on a resume and honestly i love the people there but it didn't take long maybe a few months for me to start having this feeling that i experienced a lot in high school as well where i couldn't tell how what i was doing day in and day out was getting me any closer to the dreams that i had for myself when i first started having those feelings my first thought was that i wanted to leave my job but after having a conversation with a close friend of mine i decided that i should stick it out and i should try to improve my situation before acting on my first impulse to leave so after six months i moved into a new role with the company in an entirely different state and i took on new responsibilities with the hope that by changing things up i might experience a renewed sense of excitement for my work i gave this new role another six months and even though i loved the people that i worked with i knew at this point that working a nine to five just wasn't for me and even though i knew deep down that i wanted to quit i hadn't absolutely made up my mind yet because i was terrified of leaving for a few reasons first and foremost i was scared of running out of money by this point i had paid off my student loans but i was in the job for the money and i was making a steady paycheck and i was afraid of losing that second i was scared of leaving the people that i worked with i developed great relationships at my job and i was afraid of losing them but i was also afraid that i was kind of screwing them over by adding more work to their plates by leaving and i really didn't want to do that and the third thing i was scared of and this one was huge was the uncertainty that i was going to face once i became unemployed yes a big part of this was the fact that i didn't know where my next paycheck was going to come from but there were also things like not knowing what i was going to do next or what i would tell people when they asked what i did for a living and honestly just the overall fear of the unknown up to that point my entire life had been more or less scripted for me go to school until you're 18 go to college until you're 22 or 23 get a job until you're 65 or whatever age you've saved up enough to be able to retire and the idea of taking a leap outside of that structure that i was so used to and had become so comfortable with was really scary i mold over these fears and what i really wanted to do for months and i ultimately came to a conclusion that completely changed my perspective this one realization allowed me to overcome all three fears that i mentioned earlier plus other smaller ones as well what i concluded after months of reflection and reading and introspection is that i value time exponentially more than i value any other non-living thing in this world now consider this with me for a second between the ages of 22 when you graduate college and 65 when you retire 43 years will pass out of those 43 years assuming that you sleep for an average of eight hours a night you'll spend 14 of those sleeping so that leaves 29 years between the ages of 22 and 65 that you'll actually spend a week and if you work on average eight hours per day and 260 days per year then you'll spend 10 of those 29 waking years at your job so if you work a nine to five that you don't enjoy that leaves you 19 years to spend doing the things that you love and when you start to add in other tasks that you have to do throughout the day like taking a shower cleaning your house cooking your meals that number begins to get even smaller and i'm not including any of the time spent taking care of kids because if you don't love that even when that stuff sucks then you probably shouldn't become a parent but either way the point is that we have a lot less time to spend doing the things that we love than a lot of us probably think and that brings me back to my conclusion about valuing time more than almost anything else in the world think about it you can trade time and a lot of other things for money but you can't trade anything else in the entire world for more time once time is gone it's gone for good and the less you have of it the more valuable it becomes and right now at this very moment this is the youngest you'll ever be again in your entire life i don't know about you but that completely blew my mind when i started to think about it even five seconds ago when i just started that sentence that was the youngest you were ever gonna be in your life you'll never be that young again and once i start to take that perspective i know myself and i know that when i'm older i'll be haunted by the fact that i spent my very limited time doing anything other than the things that i absolutely loved especially while i was young there's a quote from danish philosopher soren kierkegaard that says life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards and that is so true but if you understand that then you can try to make decisions now based on the perspective that you'll have in the future so the way i like to do this and i genuinely think everyone should practice this much more often imagine you're 80 years old you're drinking coffee in the morning overlooking the ocean and you're reflecting back on your life and thinking about what you would do differently if you had the chance now from the perspective of your 80 year old self think about the situation that you're currently faced with what would make 80 year old you happy and what would make 80 year old you regretful when you're old and gray and wrinkly will you regret sticking with a job that you don't enjoy to make some money rather than going out to pursue the things that you really enjoy that make you happy personally i know that i would and that's what allowed me to make the decision to leave my job even though i didn't know what i would do next at the end of the day i just want to be in control of my time because in the grand scheme of things we have so little of it and my biggest fear in life is sitting on that balcony when i'm 80 looking out over the ocean and regretting the things that i didn't do because i was afraid and even though i think that this example is extremely powerful and it's helped me make a lot of decisions in my life recently it's also flawed because it assumes that we'll actually live to be 80 years old now to be fair some of us will live longer than 80 some of us much longer but a lot of us won't even make it to 80. in reality no day is guaranteed i could die tomorrow and if that's the case i don't want to spend the majority of my final days doing something that i don't absolutely love and for me personally i just didn't love my 9 to 5 job in my personal opinion that perspective is the most powerful way to make big decisions but if people need a more practical approach that's a little bit more logical and hands-on rather than emotional then i highly recommend giving this exercise a try it's called fear setting and it was designed by tim ferriss and the first time that i heard about it was in his ted talk which i'll link below so i'll explain it high level here and if you want to go further you want to dive into the details i encourage you to check out his full presentation first you take a blank piece of paper and i recommend using a physical piece of pen and paper rather than your computer i've just found it to be more impactful at the top you write down the words what if i and then you follow that up with whatever it is that you're afraid of doing for example i wrote what if i quit my job but you could also write something like what if i put myself out there on social media or what if i ask my boss for a raise then just below that you create three columns the first column is labeled define and this is where you'll write down all the worst case scenarios all the things you're afraid of happening if you actually take action and do what you wrote at the top of the paper for me it was what if i quit my job and i run out of money but continuing along with the other examples it could be what if i put myself out there on social media and i become embarrassed or what if i ask my boss for a raise and she fires me like i said it's worst case scenarios the second column is labeled prevent and as you might guess this is where you're gonna write down everything you can do to prevent the worst case scenario from happening or at least as tim says decrease the likelihood so for me it was to prevent running out of money i could find myself a part-time job but it could also be to avoid feeling embarrassed i will look inward instead of outward for validation or to prevent being fired from my boss i'll prepare data points to showcase the results that i've produced over the past year and the third column is labeled repair and this is where you're going to write down everything that you would do to repair the damage if your preventions don't work and your worst case scenarios actually do end up coming true for me it was if i run out of money then i'll sell my car but it could also be if i become embarrassed then i'll stop posting until i experience more growth or if i lose my job then i'll network with family and friends to find a new one so once you fill in those three columns that wraps up part one of a three-part exercise part two is defining all the benefits of partial success or at least an attempt at what you wrote at the top of page one and part three is the cost of inaction so if you don't take action and do what you wrote down on the top of page one then what might that inaction cost you down the road and if you're anything like me what you'll likely find after completing part one of fear setting is that a some of your fears are actually valid and they're things that you should genuinely pay attention to and consider before taking action and b in my opinion more importantly most of your fears aren't actually as scary as you thought and a lot of them are preventable the moral of the story is that life is way too short to spend our time doing things that we don't genuinely enjoy and as seneca so wisely put it we suffer more often in imagination than we do in reality in other words the things that we fear so much like quitting our job aren't really as scary as we think they are if you have any questions about fear setting like i said check out tim's video but also feel free to leave a comment under the video and i'll do my very best to answer so obviously everybody's situation is different everybody's circumstances are unique i feel very grateful and very privileged to be able to actually quit my job and spend some time trying to figure out what i want to do with my life i completely respect and understand that there are a lot of people who don't have this luxury but i just wanted to provide my perspective in case anybody else is in a situation that's similar or even if the situation is a little bit different maybe this perspective will help them make other decisions in their life if they're not able to leave their job time is valuable so i really appreciate you spending your time with me i hope you get out of this video as much as i put into it if you did please share with others who you think it might help as well subscribe if you want more content like this feel free to leave a comment below with any feedback on how i can improve if you've ever thought about wanting to be more authentic on social media but you're afraid to take action you might enjoy my video here where i explained exactly why i decided to be more authentic and how i overcame the fear of putting myself out there thanks a lot for watching to the very end i really appreciate it live your life to the fullest today and i'll see you next time [Music] you\n",
