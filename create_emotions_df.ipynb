It’s a money trap', 'Kinda like a rat trap', 'You get stuck, and you can’t escape', '  So U go to work at your job everyday so u get paid your salary at the end of the month, so you can   then pay your bills and finance your life and so on', 'And the thing is, once you got a job, you’re   like - hey I’m all set', 'I did what I was supposed to do', 'Money’s gonna be coming in at the end of   every month', 'Financial problems solved', 'Time to just chill with the limited time off from work', '  You can’t blame any of us for thinking that', 'The job’s usually already pretty consuming as it is', '  So then for most salaried employees, the job is the only source of income', 'That was exactly   the case for me too', 'It’s all fine and dandy if you’re happy with the configuration', 'But what if   you wanted to opt out? It’s a trap, you can’t', 'You could have been spending your life n time   n energy n inspiration and all that good stuff u hv to give, building your own businesses and   income streams n dreams, but you didn’t', 'You had a job, you spend all that good stuff building other   people’s businesses and companies', 'And now you need that salary so you can’t opt out of the job', '  Which brings me to my second realisation about money, which is that money, even a lot of it,   isn’t actually an adequate compensation for what the job takes away from us.', '  I think', 'Of course, that’s ultimately a value judgement that you, as an individual hv to   make about your specific job in your particular circumstances', 'But let me elaborate a little bit   more, you know, just in case you’ve been too busy working to look up and realise   what it is that’s being taken from you', 'With your nice salary, they essentially buy your time,   your emotions, your personal relationships, your freedom, your physical health, your mental health,   even your sense of individuality', 'Did you realise? there’s no strict 9-5 really, is there?

So then my third big realisation about money is really what kicked me across the line   to quitting', 'And it’s simple really', 'Money controls us until you learn to control your money', '  When I was a salaried employee I never learnt to control my money', 'I had my fat   pay check every month, I spent it carelessly in the little free time I had to do so, cos,   u know, why else do I work so hard? I didn’t have a budget', 'I didn’t track my expenses', 'I didn’t   know a thing about saving smart and investing cos hell, I was already making so much money', '  And guess what? I made loads of money in those 6+ years', 'But when I decided to quit n leave, sadly,   I didn’t have a significant sum of savings with which to start my new life', 'I had some money,   but considering all that I actually earned in all that time, it was just … sad', 'Where did it all go?   Well, there were some clues…… a lot of it was hanging out in my closet,   branded clothes, handbags, shoes n what not', 'A big chunk of the rest had been digested…', '  And looking back I was like… OMG', 'What was I thinking? The real power of money is not   that you can buy all sorts of things that you want', 'Feeling like someone else owns your time,   your emotions and your life is horrible', 'The real power is that you are able to buy the   freedom to live on your own terms', 'To spend your time how you like, when you like, where you like', '  Once you realise that, all the other things… they become so easy to give up', '  I took a good hard look at my life', 'From the point where I thought there was a chance I might quit,   I needed to make sure I could quit', 'So first up is always: Housekeeping', 'What are the liabilities?   Mortgage', 'Car', 'Monthly expenditure', 'Take stock and start to understand where all your money goes   every month', 'Next: financial planning', 'In my case, for example, If I quit & left singapore to pursue   my dreams, I could rent out the apartment', 'I could get rid of the car', 'My lifestyle costs would   automatically downgrade as a consequence of living in a place with generally cheaper living costs,   reducing my expenditure', 'You get the idea', 'And what about the future? How was I going to generate   money for my life? Well, if I had been a savvy financial planner back then, what I ideally should   have done is to build up as much buffer of savings as was possible before I actually quit,   and to start investing the hell out of those savings as early as possible, to grow my wealth,   to build passive income streams, to diversify my income as well', 'As it turned out,   I wasn’t smart enough back then', 'I actually did what most people wd agree is the dumbest   thing possible in the situation', 'I quit with the savings that I had, n then I went off to   “figure it all out”', 'Well, luckily for me, it turned out ok in the end, and so that’s a whole   other story for another day', 'But hey, if you’re watching this video n thinking bout quitting,   don’t do what I did', 'Do that whole saving, planning and investing stuff instead   as much as u can before u quit', 'You’ll have a much easier time of it after the quitting, I assure u', '  And beyond all these big hard hitting realisations about money, there’s actually something more   important that we all have to consider', 'I believe we all need a why', 'I believe that for us to have a   great life, we all need a good purpose to what we do everyday', 'And just to be clear, loads of money   usually isn’t good enough to fill you with the same sense of fulfilment and satisfaction,   for most people at least', 'Life doesn’t need to be a dreary painful cycle one endures', '  Life should be colourful, full of joy and passion', 'We should all be spending our lives   doing what makes us feel alive and fulfilled and motivated and eager for the next day and the next', '  When I quit, I wasn’t just running away from my horrible salaried employee existence', 'I was   actively running towards my dream', 'My dream was to live an active life under the sun   at a beach somewhere', 'To have time to do the things I love, which was specifically surfing,   painting and reading, and to have time to have quality relationships w my family n the people   around me', 'I had this really clear vision in my head, this was what I wanted and I spent all my   years after quitting just driving myself towards this point', 'I wanted to do work in only that which   I felt passionate about, having spent so many years working pretty much just for the paycheck', '  I didn’t exactly know what that was at the point when I actually quit', '  But over time I learnt that I love teaching physical stuff, showing people the joy in   yoga and surfing and gym, and I’m rather good at it generally', 'And the thing is, when you’re   working from passion, and not just because of the money, you generally do a great job', '  And then, the money follows', 'That’s the magic of the universe perhaps', 'So I had my why', 'It helps a   lot, if you’re undecided about quitting', 'Now, in case you’re one of those who haven’t found quite   discovered your why in life yet, these days there are so many ways to easily start doing that', '  And here’s where I want

hold the vision   trust the process what's up everyone welcome back to my channel the best place for new   coaches content creators and entrepreneurs in today's video i wanted to really reflect back   on the last two years since quitting my corporate job i quit my corporate job   may of 2018 and i started this youtube channel july of 2018\", \"so it has been well over two years   since i quit cold turkey created this channel and now have a multi-million dollar business   and beyond that we're at a place where not only do i have this business but i'm also employing   other people to work with me in this business so my transformation since leaving my corporate   job has been insane like even looking back i would not have even fathomed that i would get   this far just within those two years and so this video is really here to share some perspective   shifts that i've made in the last two years some life lessons that i've learned since quitting my   corporate job because i can assure you right now the way that i think today is so different than   how i was thinking two years ago when i was making these videos all about quitting the nine to five   and so if you're someone who is either debating on quitting the nine of five or maybe you just   quit the nine of five i wanna offer some wisdom i wanna offer some perspective changes i want   to offer some insight on things that you might also learn as you grow as you develop and as you   have and accumulate more life experiences after leaving the nine to five and it doesn't matter if   you've left the nine of five to start your own business it doesn't matter if you've left your   nine to five and you have no back-up plan and you're super lost like how i was two years ago   or if you're leaving your nine-to-five for another nine to five whatever big change that you're going   through right now i hope that this video can really kind of support you and make you feel   like you're more supported and also give you some perspective shifts that you might not see   right now but you might see maybe a month or a year later on so if you're interested in learning   about what i have to say and my experiences since quitting the nine of five then keep on watching   i was so afraid to start over i was so afraid to let go of all the years of work that i put in to   get to the place that i'm at i was so afraid of starting rock bottom that i was just fearful of   letting it go and it's so silly to think about it now because i already knew the environment that i   was in wasn't serving me i already knew that i didn't like doing what i was doing but because   i was so fixated on the past and i was so fixated on all the accumulation of work energy resources   that i put in to get to the position that i was in to get to the company that i was in that i   just couldn't see how i could possibly let it go and now that i'm on the other side of it   i'm so glad i let it go and what i've learned too is quitting is not a bad thing and i think that i   was conditioned so long to think that quitting was shameful quitting is something that says   something about you that says that you couldn't handle it that you couldn't take it that you   weren't strong enough but quitting takes a lot of courage it takes a lot of courage to stand up for   what you believe in it takes a lot of courage to demand a better environment for yourself it   takes a lot of courage to start over and it takes a lot of courage to say no when you are quitting   something it doesn't have to mean that you're a failure instead whenever i hear my friends and   hear that they've quit their jobs or you guys who message me and tell me that you've quit your job i   am always seeing it in the lens of congratulations congratulations for choosing a different future   congratulations on putting a bet on yourself congratulations on actually changing your   environment because at the end of the day what you aren't changing you are choosing if you decide   hey you know what i'm just going to stay at this job that i hate but yet you complain about that   job every single day you have to ultimately take responsibility for that choice that you've made   because if you're not quitting and if you're not choosing to let it go and do something else then   you're essentially choosing the opposite which is staying in that situation and that's not on anyone   else it's not on your boss it's not on your mom your parents your family your friends it's on you   when you say no to something you're actually saying yes to other things you might not be able   to see what you're saying yes to yet especially if you're like me and you're quitting cold turkey but   you might not be able to see you know what you're making more space for but just understand that you   are making more space because if you're choosing to stay in a situation that's already putting you   at capacity in terms of your tolerance in terms of your energy in terms of your mental space   nothing else is going to be able to come through in your life you're not going to be able to   receive anything else that perspective has really you know helped me in having better boundaries too   even today in my business even today i choose to say no to a lot of things because the act   of quitting my job two years ago taught me that valuable lesson that when i say no to something   i'm saying yes to something else even if that something else happens two years later or a year   later or five years later you know i'm making space and if i already know i don't want to do   something if i already know that whatever is being presented to me doesn't put me in expansion and   it doesn't make me excited and it doesn't you know make me want to spring out of bed and say heck yes   then it's a no on top of that understand that you are capable of doing new things and a   good question that i like to ask people because oftentimes especially with entrepreneurs because   i know a lot of you guys who watch my channel are interested in starting a business you know   oftentimes you can't distinguish the difference between something that's new versus something that   you actually aren't good at or something that you really don't like doing oftentimes you have to ask   yourself is something hard because it's new or is something hard because you're actually incompetent   or because you actually don't like doing the task and i think that this is also something that   i've learned over time especially with starting a business and even maintaining a business at every   stage of growth whether you are starting at zero in your business or whether you have a million   dollar business or a 10 million dollar business at every stage you're gonna need to do new things   you're gonna need to learn new things with new things come with a lot of discomfort it comes   with a lot of self-doubt because these are things that you've never done before i remember i was so   hard on myself after quitting my nine-to-five and i was like why aren't i up and running yet how   come my business isn't successful yet how come my life isn't perfect yet i quit my job now what how   come it's not happening for me but you have to realize like quitting your job is a really big   deal and quitting your job is something you likely have never done before or maybe even starting a   business is something you've never done before or starting a new job in a different industry is   something that you've never done before or just taking a break quitting your job just to find   yourself is also something that you've never done before but as type a humans as overachievers which   i think a lot of you guys who watch my channel pretty much have the same profile as me i know   it's so easy again to make that mean something about us it's so easy to think that oh my gosh   this is hard therefore i'm not good enough this is hard therefore i must be stupid this is hard   therefore building a business or changing careers or doing whatever must not be for me and so one of   my favorite mantras in this year actually is i am capable of doing hard things and to me what   this means is for so long i would always avoid the hard things because i didn't think that i   was capable of doing them and a good example and it kind of leads back to the whole spiel that i   talked about about intelligence one of my weakest points is math i barely passed math in university   i think i passed with like 53 i passed by 3 and even throughout high school i got straight a's   great for me but it took a lot of tutors to make that happen it took a lot of office hours to even   get an a in grade 12 math because i wasn't great at it i wasn't good at it and even when i worked   in corporate you know it's filled with all these spreadsheets about how the company is doing and   the growth and all these things and i would spend so long on google trying to figure out excel and   how to you know calculate percentage growth and percentage difference and to this day i still   need to google percentage difference calculator to figure it out right and so because of these   instances that i had in my life i immediately associated myself as someone who isn't good with   numbers and that in some sense haunted me as i was building my business i was always avoiding looking   at the numbers and understanding my analytics and just understanding the financial side of things i   avoided looking at money avoided looking at all those things because i kept telling myself that   i wasn't good at it until something just snapped this year and i told myself you know what like i   am capable of doing hard things i'm gonna roll up my sleeves and i'm gonna learn this i'm gonna ask   questions i'm gonna go to my cpa and ask as many questions as i want i'm gonna go to my mentor   and be in this mastermind even though other people in this mastermind have years more experience   than i do i'm gonna raise my hand and say hey i don't know how to do this can you help me or hey   i have a question i know it might be a silly one but i need to understand these numbers and fast   forward today in my business my transformation and my relationship with numbers specifically for   you could be something different has completely changed in my business spreadsheet like a boss   i love reading my numbers every week i ask my team to share the numbers we are so data driven   now in my business and i freaking love it i love the fact that i can join meetings and understand   what we're talking about i love the fact that i'm able to interpret data on a spreadsheet   back then i hated it and i also associated that with my identity i said you know i'm just someone   who's not good with numbers and therefore don't touch numbers at all but now that i've overcome   that and that i've rolled up my sleeves to learn the numbers now my identity and my beliefs have   completely changed which shows to me that it's not that i never liked doing numbers it's just that i   never took the time to learn and i never took the time to learn because i kept telling myself and i   kept identifying myself as someone who wasn't good with numbers what i want to share with you two   years later since quitting the corporate job is when you quit something to do something new there   are gonna be new things that you've never done and because you've never done them it's gonna be   super painful super uncomfortable and there will be self-doubt but just understand that it's okay   to start over and that you are capable of learning new things and you're capable of doing hard things   and after you overcome that and after you learn the thing or you do the damn thing you're then   going to be able to truly assess whether it's something that you don't like doing at all or if   it's something that you just didn't know how to do but once you learn it you actually like it because   it's really important in life to just know the difference between something that truly puts you   in contraction something that you truly don't like doing don't want to do don't have a desire to do   and when you do it even if you're good at it you just hate it versus something that is just unknown   to you and therefore you have resistance around it starting a business doing something new is going   to be hard for everyone and until you actually get over that hump and get over that resistance   and you do the damn thing you're then going to be able to collect the data and assess whether this   is something that you truly as a human being to your core hate doing in which case especially if   you have a business now you know this is something you need to outsource or if it's something that   you're actually capable of doing that you could be good at doing but you're just avoiding it because   it's new and because it's hard and so that's one thing that i definitely learned in my last   two years since quitting the corporate job that i wish i knew sooner and i hope can also change   your perspective especially if you're at a place right now where things are uncomfortable you will   grow through it and that's another little thing that i've learned too is growth is not designed   to be easy every time i have a mental breakdown in business or i feel you know a type of way or i cry   in business or my mind is just filled with anxiety and scary thoughts and just fear a lot of times   it's because i'm doing something new a lot of times it's because i am doing something that i've   never done before and every time that i go through that my business income wise has always taken   huge leaps and what i want to say about this is the fact that the result of growth is fun and   dandy the result of growth is something that you put in your instagram bio that you brag to your   friends about that you know you really are proud of but the process of growth is very uncomfortable   you will cry and it's not fun it's not fun but it's not fun because you're doing something that   you've never done before and so i know that i'm saying the same thing pretty much over and over   again but i can't emphasize enough how important it is in life to just understand that and sit in   that discomfort of doing the unknown sit in the discomfort of doing something big and huge that   you've never done before and sit in the discomfort that you don't know everything and that's okay   because there is time to learn it but if you have so much resistance in the beginning to even take   the first step to learn then you are deciding and you are choosing to stay in the same place forever   and so that's one thing that you definitely want to keep in mind of as you embark in a new   chapter of your life now the next lesson that i've learned since quitting my corporate job   is if there is something that you are afraid to say out loud there's something that you want to do   that you're embarrassed about to say out loud that you don't even want to admit out loud you should   wholeheartedly pursue it this is coming from a place where i have been wanting to start a   damn youtube channel since high school and that's like a long time ago like over 10 years ago over a   decade ago it was always something that i really couldn't say out loud because i was embarrassed   but every new year's every time i was goal-setting i'd always write it in my notebook and it's funny   because when i actually quit my corporate job nobody really knew what the heck i was doing and   even though i say i had no idea what i was doing and i quit cold turkey and stuff deep down inside   i knew i wanted to start a youtube channel from some sort but i didn't want to tell people that   i'm not saying that you need to shout it to the rooftops of what you want to do in life and share   it with everyone and post tweet about it or do a facebook update about it i think that it's   okay to keep it to yourself but if you're watching this video and you are on the cusp of potentially   making a change in your life and potentially taking a leap of faith i just want to at least put   this in this video and give you the permission to do the thing that you're afraid of saying out loud   do the thing that you have been thinking about non-stop for years do the thing that you journal   about all the time when you are in the comfort of your own privacy you know do it because life is   too short not to do it and also there's a reason why year over year you're thinking of doing the   thing that you want to do there's a reason why it's never left your mind and oftentimes   when you do it you might actually realize that you don't really like it and it's not for you in which   case now you can pivot and now you have even more time to figure out what you want to do in life or   the thing that you're afraid of saying out loud that you truly want to do it could be the thing   that changes your life it could be the thing that is so powerful the moment that you do it   that ends up really changing your life 180 just like how mine did it's almost as if like the thing   that you're thinking of doing is just so powerful and so big and you know that it's something that   would probably make you super happy and that would put you in expansion and that would really unleash   all of your strengths sometimes i wonder if it's so powerful and that's why we're so afraid of   saying it out loud because a little piece of us thinks that what if it would actually work what if   i'm actually successful at it what if it actually ends up changing my life and sometimes it's a very   scary thought to think about and i know that for a lot of us we journal about success we talk about   all the things that we want to achieve but those big things that we want to achieve often scare us   thing that you're thinking of doing is just such a big concept that you're afraid to say out loud and   that's okay but i just want to give you permission to actually do it because you have no idea what   doors can open if you do it and even if you do it and it fails or even if you do it and you realize   you don't like it at least you checked it off your list of things to do and now you can move   on to other things or in the process of doing that thing you might potentially or even accidentally   open doors to something greater now another lesson that i've learned since quitting my corporate job   two years ago is you will have silent supporters and just because you don't visibly see people   supporting you doesn't mean that you should give up i know especially if you are someone who is   thinking of quitting your job to start a business or maybe you've already done that and you're in   the beginning stages of starting your business it can feel like nobody is supporting you especially   if you are doing something similar to me and you're putting yourself out there on social media   you're not getting the views you're not getting the likes you're not getting the comments you   aren't getting that public recognition that you expect to have just know that there are people who   are rooting for you behind the scenes and people who don't publicly comment on things but are   watching your every move and this is coming from a place of two years later now that i have built   what i've built i actually get a lot of referrals from people who i used to be friends with or   people i used to go to work with or i've also had people from my friend's circle or my corporate   circle by my program the boss graham academy which is insane i actually have an old manager of mine   who enrolled in the program and i have a few other people that i have crossed paths with in my life   that have also enrolled in this program too and it's incredible to see and i'm just so glad that   in the beginning i continued to create content and i continued to trek on even though majority   of the people that i was doing content for was likely my friends and family and even if they   didn't publicly comment on my stuff the fact that they know what i was working on helped me in the   long run and what i've learned too is that even though your friends and family might not be your   ideal client or your ideal you know customer or whatever or your ideal subscriber ideal follower   the fact that they're even aware of what you're doing can truly help you with referrals can truly   help you get closer to people who are going to be interested in your content so another example is i   would not stop sharing my stuff on my personal instagram and actually the instagram that i have   today is the same instagram that i have had since college you know i would not stop sharing my stuff   i would not stop posting stories and i would not stop sharing myself to my personal facebook i was   sharing everything left right front and center and it's so interesting because often times i would   have people who follow me and they would say hey i followed you because my friend recommended your   profile i'm actually really hating my corporate job too can you tell me more about what you offer   and the person that would refer them would be my coworkers or my friends who them themselves have   no interest in what i'm working on but the fact that they know what i'm working on if they're   in contact with their own networks and their own friends and they're talking about certain subjects   that i share on my channel then they're gonna be like hey actually i have a friend vanessa who does   stuff like that let me send you her youtube channel and it's so interesting because in   the beginning i thought that my friends and my family don't support me and blah blah blah but   even if they don't visibly support you and they don't watch all your videos the fact that they   are aware of what you're working on again can help you so much in getting connected to other people   in their network it's all about referrals and i think that it's such a shame that a lot of newer   entrepreneurs they'll start secret instagram accounts or secret youtube channels and never   share that to their friends and family because they're embarrassed but what you have to realize   is you're actually closing yourself off of getting more views of getting more subscribers of getting   you more connected to people who would actually benefit from whatever project or whatever business   or whatever path that you're on right now don't shy away from sharing things even if it feels like   nobody is supporting your business or nobody's supporting your new career change right from the   get-go but anyways guys this video is definitely really long i hope that it was valuable i hope   i was able to share some perspective and some insights and i really hope that you in some sense   feel supported feel more grounded or just feel a little bit lighter since watching this video as   always i post a lot of videos on entrepreneurship marketing social media all the likes of that   so definitely check out these two videos that i have right here if you like this video share it   on your stories make sure you don't forget to tag me as always guys i appreciate you i hope   you guys have a great day a great week and a great life and i will see you in the next video bye guys \"]), ('imR1vl15MkU', [\"[Music] foreign [Applause] [Music]   Just follow your dreams! That's what they say, right? But is it true? Is that actually good   advice? Should you just follow your dreams? Should you just quit your job and jump into the unknown?   Or should you just stay where you are right now? After all, it's pretty comfortable right? Well, in 2018, I decided to find out for myself because my dream was to   become a travel photographer and so I quit my job, sold my car, and canceled the lease   on our apartment\", 'And we started traveling', 'Indefinitely', 'India', 'Southeast Asia', 'Australia', '  South America', 'Mexico', 'United States', 'We traveled around the world for two years straight', \"[Music]   But we were a few years later now and we're not traveling anymore\", \"We're living in Belgium   again\", 'Yep, that sure looks like Belgium', \"We're renting a new apartment, still no car, though\", \"So,   what happened? I mean, does quitting your job and following your dream and passion actually   work? Does it change anything at all? Wow, that went from an exciting and uplifting intro to   a depressing one real fast, right? But don't worry because this right here me staring into   the distance that's just me acting so don't worry I am happy even though I didn't become a travel   photographer yeah it didn't happen now if you're watching this video then you probably also have   the feeling that you don't belong or you're stuck in a job that you don't like and you're dreaming   of doing something different so should you just quit then and chase that dream well maybe and   maybe not because let me just tell you what happened ever since I quit my job and started   traveling and remember guys I did this when I was 35 you know with back pains, rusty knees and you   know, according to some people you should have already figured out your life at the age of 30\", \"  I can tell you already those people are wrong I'm 39 now and I still haven't figured out everything   yet I don't know what I'm doing most of the time so you know if you're in your 20s don't   worry anyway if you have questions that don't get answered in this video just drop them in the   comments okay let's go so I studied photography and I graduated in 2009\", \"before that I actually   graduated in computer technology but that doesn't matter right now I just want to brag a little bit   um anyway so yeah and then I ended up in a job as a graphic designer slash photographer in a   Pet Products company and back then that was the perfect job I learned a lot but of course taking   photos of dog toys and designing packagings for cat snacks that wasn't really what I wanted to do   I wanted to be a Travel Photographer a documentary photographer like the great Steve McCurry that's   what I wanted to be so I decided to work towards that goal in my free time I traveled whenever I   could a few weeks a year year I worked on projects and I found out that I was actually good at it my   work got published I won awards so great right well no because the thing was it didn't really   go anywhere despite all the Publications and awards and then all of a sudden I realized   that I was already working at that company for eight nine years I mean what the hell happened   where did time go eight years and the older you get the more likely it is that you'll experience   something similar all of a sudden you're 35 45 55 and boom what the hell happened where did all   that time go and that's when something clicked in my head something like a switch got switched   and yeah that's when I decided maybe I should just quit my job and start traveling full time   that's the solution well in my head that was the solution of course I didn't know if it was   actually the solution but anyway I asked Joanna do you want to go traveling for at least a year   she said yes and a few weeks later I quit my job then I sold my car and we canceled our apartment   now just so you know Joanna didn't have a job at the time so I didn't force her to also quit   her job just so you know now a lot of people have told me that they find doing something like that   quitting your job and just go traveling for two years they find it scary and abnormal and it kind   of is because very few people do it but it's funny let me show you something so quitting my job was   actually a turning point for me but until then I was living before that turning point and from that   before perspective the Turning Point looked scary because for the turning point to have happen I had   to make a decision to change something in my life but once I was past the Turning Point looking back   I realized it wasn't so scary at all and so that's the problem if more people would know how changing   something in your life makes you feel after you've changed it more people would do it and it doesn't   have to be quitting your job it doesn't have to be so drastic it could be something smaller like   enrolling in a class to learn a new skill or just switching jobs but people are afraid of change so   they only see turning points from that scary before perspective which of course keeps them   from changing something in their life so what you have to do is try to look past that decision past   the turning point and just do it do it just do it okay yeah thank you Shia uh I hope it   all makes sense I kind of feel like one of those life coaching gurus and I'm not a life coaching   Guru this is just my experience of Life anyway of course I still had some doubts it still was   a jump into the unknown but what I did know was that it would be a once in a lifetime experience   for sure I told Joanna not to worry about anything I would plan everything we would spend my savings   because I made the decision to quit my job I was the one who had to make it work I think it   took us four or five months to plan everything sell everything cancel everything get the right   papers and documents and then the day was there we set off on our trip around the world first country   India and that was it we were actually traveling now it was really happening I was taking photos   every day I tried to come up with ideas for projects but of course no money was coming in   I was relying on almost 10 years of savings but I didn't want to spend everything I was willing   to rely on them for maybe six months you know give me some time to figure out how to make money   while traveling and before we left I also had prepared my website some digital products things   like that I also started writing a blog when we left it's still online by the way so there was   some kind of plan but no money coming in yet and in the back of my mind was still the thought of   yeah like when I had a nine to five job I was also trying to make money with my documentary   photography and my travel photography but it didn't work it didn't go anywhere so why would   it be any different now that I was traveling well the difference now was that something had changed   in my life remember the turning point and that change disrupted my routine it pulled me out of my   safe bubble it it broke the safe bubble and what that did was it changed Something In Here Also   and that had never happened before all of a sudden I was trying out different ideas I was trying to   find a way to make money while traveling and I was actually executing those ideas most of them   didn't work but that was fine because I felt like everything was moving everything kept changing I   felt progress slowly but surely and then by the end of year one I actually found a way to make   money while traveling something worked I started writing articles for websites and magazines about   traveling and about photography and cameras I also sold some digital products now it wasn't   my dream job but you know what I actually liked it because it motivated me I was actually making   money while traveling now now do keep in mind that I had those savings 10 years worth of savings and   it was a significant amount of money and it was also possible for us to leave everything behind   just like that so I realized that I found myself in a luxury position not everyone can do that and   if you try to do something like that without savings then I mean the pressure to make money   it would probably feel paralyzing right so I'm all for taking risk but calculated risks have a   basic plan but anyway what also happened very important slowly I started to find out that I   didn't actually wanted to be a Travel Photographer per se you know do assignments for magazines and   things like that because before that that was the dream but now all of a sudden my dream was not my   dream anymore what I realized was that what I actually wanted was just being self-employed   something that had to do with cameras of course and also something that I could do from anywhere   in the world so remote work that was what my dream actually was but I didn't realize it   before it just took time to find out that that was it so from then on that was the focus I expanded   my webshop I started doubling down on my YouTube channel I was also still writing articles so some   money came in not a lot but just enough to keep me going and keep me motivated and there was a   clear goal now not just a vague dream but it took time to find out it takes time to find out what   you want to do and sometimes also how to do it if you need to learn a new skill for example and   even if you think you have a dream it might not be your dream after all that's what I learned   from all this and it all started at the turning point I only started making progress when I made   a change in my life before that there was eight nine years of no progress okay so let's summarize   I quit my job to follow my dream of becoming a Travel Photographer and then I didn't become a   Travel Photographer here I am now I'm a YouTuber slash Video Creator I have my own little business   here I make videos for clients for companies I make YouTube videos it's working and I love it   so should you just quit your job and follow your dreams then just go for it just do it just do it   well if you can if you don't have three kids to feed mortgage to pay a lot of bills to pay if you   can't just leave everything behind and go travel like we did do it I highly recommended you won't   regret it but we have to be realistic here blindly quitting your job and chasing a dream is not a   solution nor an option for most people but that doesn't mean that you should just stay miserable   then of course not I think that a lot of people who feel stuck in a job that they don't like what   they need is change it was that change in my life that caused the disruption of my routine   and that kick-started the progress and making a change doesn't mean quit your job and follow   your dream it doesn't have to be so drastic but it has to be significant enough to disrupt your   routine so that you get pulled out of your safe bubble so that something in here can change that's   important as long as something in here doesn't change nothing will happen so try switching jobs   or try to find a halftime job so that you can spend more time doing whatever it is you think   you want to do and if that's not possible do something smaller enroll in that web design   course or pottery class I don't know whatever but you have to initiate change yourself do it I feel   like one of those gurus again but yeah that's what I think and even if it's a small ripple at first   the change that you make it will get bigger and change leads to more change and to better things   eventually and it'll be a long winding path with mistakes along the way but that's fine just don't   wait until next week because next week all of a sudden you'll be 80 or dead foreign [Music] \"]), ('y7yr-za_Meo', ['Film

are built for sometimes in life we come across a quote that changes the course of our lives and this was   the quote that recently changed mine it's a great quote that challenges us to go against our fears   and take risks to broaden our worldview it's not the first time i've heard it but this time   it really spoke to me since i've been stuck in a transitional phase in my career for some time some of you guys know that for the past four years i've been working for a non-profit agency   where i taught about homeownership and financial literacy to the affordable housing recipients   through the job i had incredible opportunities to teach my course in women's shelters homeless   shelters and to high school students who are preparing to go out into the world like any job most days were spent tediously filing away papers and making routine phone calls but   then there were days when i was able to witness my clients receive their keys to the first home   and these moments outshined all the difficult ones i played a small role for a big mission and through the job i learned what it   meant to think bigger than myself and it humbled me and always imaginable   so you're probably thinking why would she even think about leaving such an amazing job   i guess it was my time to see what's out there for me in the open seas i wanted to update you guys on what's been going on in my life and as from the title you probably   already know but i recently quit my job i wanted to talk about why i quit my job what i plan to   do moving forward and how important i think it is to honor the change that happens within us   so here's my story i graduated as a philosophy major and i had no idea what i wanted to do with   it but one thing i was always sure of was that i wanted to do something meaningful with my time   i was 26 very new to the island and somehow my boss decided to take a chance on me and that's   how i landed my first job at the non-profit agency like i mentioned so many times on my   channel but this really was my dream job basically my job was to teach people in the community and in   order to do that i really had to know a lot about real estate to create my curriculum i really had   to know the ins and outs of how a non-profit agency worked and i had to speak in front of a   lot of different people big crowds small crowds so i had to work on my public speaking skills   the salary was okay but it was steady and i could really see myself doing this for the long run   within our jobs i think we all have aspects that we like more than others then it's only natural   for us to start diving deeper into that one topic which then could spiral into something else   for me i became really interested in learning more about real estate so after work i would come   home and i would just research more about real estate investing and how i can do more diy home   projects by myself at one point i even thought about branching out and becoming a real estate   agent or maybe even taking my course and teaching it on youtube and i even thought about opening up   maybe my own interior design company i had so many different ideas but the point is i found   myself constantly thinking about new ways that i could transition from my current position i didn't   realize that at the time but it's clear to me now that i had clearly outgrown my job and naturally   i wanted to expand and branch out and learn something new and i think when we begin to feel   that it's only right for us to honor it and think of how we can pivot from our current trajectory a couple of years ago i came across a quote from jordan peterson that really   stuck with me order is not enough you can't just be stable and secure and unchanging because they   are still vital and important new things to be learned nonetheless chaos can be too much   thus you need to place one foot in what you have mastered and understood and the other and what you   are currently exploring and mastering quitting my job didn't happen overnight it was actually   premeditated for many years i think the first thing i did was write a proposal to my boss   and i asked her if i could teach remotely from home and to my surprise she said yes that really   freed up my time i was able to help my husband fix up this house then i also had time to start   this youtube channel i remember during that time we really had to reevaluate our budget   because our income was reduced and also whatever paycheck that we had most of it was going towards   construction materials but i think in the long run it was so worth it it was really a   small price to pay because what i was getting in exchange was some more time for me to think about   what i wanted to do moving forward while starting up these little projects on the side so i put in my two weeks notice about a month ago and it feels like i'm closing a huge chapter   in my life and actually my husband is also going through a huge transition in his life   and he's taking some time to think about how he wants to move forward for now we're okay we have   some money in our savings we have our investments and i also have this youtube channel which i'm   really grateful to all of you and i think why this youtube channel is so much fun for me   is because it's completely different than anything i've ever done i didn't really know much about   cameras or editing it was a steep learning curve and i think i really like those challenges but of   course i think about where is this going is this going to be forever and probably the answer is no   you know i'm always going to be looking for new challenges and my hobbies interests and my values   and priorities change all the time so i don't think i'm the type of person who will stick to one   thing forever and i think that's okay sometimes i even dream about opening up a little cafe   or working at a cafe or even starting a non-profit myself or really buying that mango orchard and   live off the land in the meantime i'm just gonna enjoy the ride and put my hundred percent effort   into whatever i'm doing at the time the biggest change since adopting a more minimalist lifestyle   isn't the fact that i have less things in my home and i have less pieces of clothes in my closet but   it's more the fact that i'm actively thinking more about how i can live more intentionally   i find myself asking a lot am i getting any value out of this am i still getting fulfilled   by what i'm doing and i think these questions are really vital because we change constantly i just want to say if you're not happy with your current situation   maybe you feel like you've outgrown your work maybe your hometown or even your relationships   i hope that you can find the courage and the willpower to put yourself in a position where you   can transition and i know it was so much easier for me and my husband because we have dual incomes   and also no kids so it does make it so much easier but i do believe that it has to start somewhere   and i think it starts with the right intentions it is never too late no matter what your age is   no matter how much you've invested in something   and no matter how far you've come you can always start over and i think that is truly the beauty   of life in the next few months i have so many new updates for you guys i'm really excited to   share and if you want to follow me more real time then you can go follow my instagram at malama life   let me know in the comments if you guys have been going through a transition yourself thank you guys   again so much for watching until next tuesday take care guys and i'll talk to you soon bye you \"]), ('M8md7_gyBy4', [\"see i was making about 150 000 euros a year just after a couple of years of working experience as   a data analyst eventually working as a freelancer for a big bank in Amsterdam   i honestly thought i had it all now earning more than i've   ever could dream of i bought my own house i travel a lot i even have some extra money to invest   and i've quit i've left everything behind and i've quit my job before it's too late let me explain over the last five years i've learned three lessons that made me decide to   take a risk quit my job and start living the life i want today i'm sharing them with you   lesson one at the start of my career when i was doing a traineeship i got to work for a   company through that same traineeship that built the infrastructure for big telecom providers in   holland and this company was not located near a big city in Holland and why is this important?   well the people working there were also not from a big city they had a different kind of mentality   i would say they were a little bit more down to earth maybe their life was a little slower than   those living in a big city you know how they always say in a big city everything is so fast   the tempo is a little bit higher but these guys seem a little bit more calm chill down to earth   and these guys there were mostly guys working at this company were kind of you know tough guys and   i remember one guy in particular let's call him Bert Bert was one of those like he was a tough   guy he was messing around making fun of everyone but in a light-hearted way he was a good guy and   i remember talking to him and he explained how he actually got to work for that company when he was   18 finished high school he basically just walked into in the office said hey i'm looking for a job   do you need someone they offered him his first job being in the field doing some kind of construction   building the infrastructure and he worked his way up to some kind of project management role   our department was focused on just one client and one day the client decided to pull the plug   they were not satisfied with the quality of work we were delivering and they said they did not   want to work with us anymore so from one day to the other our manager had to tell everyone in   our department that it's done we're done people had to start looking for other jobs there was   basically going to be reorganisation in the company and the moment the manager said this   some of those guys some of those 30 40 people that were working there including Bert the tough   guy started breaking down in tears and started crying i can remember them hearing them cry asking   what am i going to do how am i going to pay my mortgage how am i going to feed my kids remember   he's been working there for 40 years already and he just lost his job this was a big turning point   in my life and it was also one of the lessons i wanted to share with you today that day i realized   that no matter how hard you work no matter how permanent you think your permanent job is   there's things you don't have control over and Bert and some other guys grown men cried that   day because they didn't have a plan b because they were only dependent on one source of income   being that job that they lost that day so that's why i learned your permanent job is not   so permanent that's where i decided i eventually want to be my own boss i want to work for myself   i want to build something myself and not be dependent on a manager or a ceo or whoever   lesson number two now before this sounds like something a typical entitled millennial would say   hear me out i can remember a nice summer day back in 2021 i was walking through a nice big park in   Amsterdam with a good friend of mine it was a really sunny Friday morning i was always free   on Fridays as i had that day reserved for youtube i worked four days in a week as a data analyst so   i had one day in the week where i could focus on shooting videos writing scripts but to be honest   we didn't do any shooting that day because we were just enjoying the sun the weather our nice   conversations and we randomly came across this it looked like a swimming pool but it was only   this deep basically a swimming pool for your feet in the middle of the park in the middle of this   forest so we took off our shoes and we just stood there talking enjoying the sun and i can remember   one of the conversations we had is how this good friend of mine had a colleague at work that just   couldn't understand that my friend was only working four days a week that he wasn't working   full time and he asked my friend what do you do on that day off what do you do on that Friday i   cannot understand why wouldn't you want to work we were laughing about this because we couldn't   understand him how couldn't you appreciate an extra day off where you have extra time   to spend with your family extra time to work on your health extra time to go on adventures extra   time to work on a side project on your hobbies to learn new skills new languages there's so   many things you can do in that one extra day off and i just couldn't understand where he was coming   from why would he ask that and i asked myself why is this but to answer that question first   i need to ask myself why do we work in the first place well usually because of one of three reasons   being play purpose or pressure with pressure i mean economic pressure or emotional pressure   emotional pressure because you have to make your parents proud by becoming a successful lawyer   or doctor and economic pressure because you have to do work to get compensated so you can sustain   yourself and your life either way economic or emotional the motive for work is separate from the   work itself you do the work because you have to not because you like to do it this is actually the   worst reason to work yet ironically this is why most people work now the next motive is purpose   this motive is also separated from the work itself but you do it because you value the outcome and   the results of your work for example a nurse might not like the high stress environment she   works in but what keeps her going is the fact that she's able to help people to heal patients   same reason why people work at a charity and accept the low pay because they have a sense that   they're making a positive impact on the world that they're helping the world purpose is a very strong   motivator to work but it's still not optimal as you don't enjoy the work itself but you value   the outcome of your work and then there is players work play is what occurs when you simply like to   do something the work itself is the reward play is when you play a music instrument when you go on a   hike read a book play video games solve puzzles create videos play is when you're in a state of   flow fueled by curiosity and experimentation and for this reason people intrinsically want   to learn more and improve the work itself is the greatest motive work that feels like play   is the most powerful driver for high performance and consequently success and for success i have   one simple definition doing work that feels like play fulfills a purpose and gets you paid there   is a Japanese term for this Ikigai and there is an Ikigai for everyone if you are not lucky enough to   find your Ikigai in your current workplace then that should be your goal to create a life where   you are doing work motivated by play and purpose i mean why wouldn't you as far as i know we only   have one life that means you have about 50 60 years left to do whatever you want and i get it   if you're currently doing work motivated by pressure this costs a lot of energy both mentally   and physically after a hard day of working because you have to you want to come home and unwind how   are you going to work on building a life fueled by play and purpose if you don't have the energy   nor the time to actually do so this is what people mean when you're stuck in the rat race when you're   stuck in this 905 life but i learned it's what you do in the five to nine that determines the rest   of your life it can take one year five years maybe even 10 years but as long as you don't do anything   you'll end up in exactly the same spot you are in right now it took me about seven years to   give myself at least a shot at living the life i want to live i work my way up from a trainee to an   employer from an employer to a freelancer and from a freelancer to now currently a growing content   creator because i found creating videos and sharing stories feels most like play to me while   fulfilling a purpose and potentially getting paid enough to sustain myself and this is something   i was missing in my job as a data analyst even though there was a little bit of room to express   myself creatively in building dashboards and i got to work with cool colleagues i was missing the   sense of purpose because to be honest it wasn't fulfilling in fact i would sometimes ask myself   why am i actually doing the stuff i'm doing i could never see the positive impact i was making   on society how were my dashboards impacting society and the people around me in a positive way   it wasn't that clear but okay so now that we've learned that a full-time job is not so secure   as you think it is and that ideally you should do work that feels like play how do we actually make   a living out of play this brings me to lesson three back in high school i was around 17 years   maybe i had to make the decision of what i was going to study and therefore what i wanted to be   later on in life what kind of job i wanted to have but the thing is i had no prior work experience   yeah as delivering newspapers and working at a supermarket how was i supposed to know what   study to pick therefore what kind of job i wanted to have for the rest of my life basically i didn't   even know what it meant to have a real job what do you do all day in an office but i just had to make   one of the most important decisions in my life basically impacting the rest of my future based   on no experience and no knowledge so what did i do i just picked a study that sounded interesting the   study itself not the possibilities that i could have after studying and it really felt like i   had to pick this one thing that i was going to do for the rest of my life but nobody told me   about e-commerce nobody told me about drop shipping nobody told me about investing i   didn't know Youtubers were making money i didn't know content creation was a thing nobody told me   that it's not about getting a job and working it's about creating value and getting rewarded for it   you see you can work in a restaurant 80 hours a week but you're not going to get rich because   it's not about working hard it's about offering value and it's simple really we get compensated   proportionally to the amount of value we can bring to society to the world now when i look at myself   over the years i've acquired the skills and the knowledge to become a data analyst since   so much data is generated by companies nowadays companies need to analyze and utilize this data   to get the competitive edge they need data analyst jobs are high in demand but there are just not   enough people to fill up all those jobs good data analysts are scarce and therefore valuable but the   value i have to offer will always be limited by my time there's only so many hours in a day meaning   there's only so many dashboards and reports i can build i get compensated for the amount of hours it   takes me to build a dashboard but once i've built a dashboard and it gets used for weeks months   maybe even years long after i finished building that dashboard i don't get compensated anymore   so i get compensated for the amount of hours i put in into building the dashboard building the report   analyzing the data rather than the value it might bring to the company i get compensated for my   input the amount of hours rather than the output the value my work brings and this is the exact   reason i've quit my job to pursue something where i get rewarded fairly for the amount of value i   bring and not for how many hours i've put in when i create a video on youtube that's not valuable to   the world i don't get a lot of views and i get compensated accordingly i don't get anything   however when i do make a video that's considered valuable maybe it's entertaining or educational   and it does get a lot of views i also get rewarded accordingly it doesn't matter how many hours i've   put into creating both videos i get rewarded for my output not for my input and it gets better   my videos will exist on youtube long after i've created them meaning my videos will be of value to   some people long after i've created them meaning i will get compensated for that value it brings   long after i've created them and it gets even better i can do this at skill i can make one   video that can potentially get viewed by millions of people meaning it can be of value to millions   of people and i get compensated accordingly so my composition is not limited by my time unlike   my data analyst job and unlike the waiter at a restaurant that cannot serve a million tables at   the same time he cannot leverage his skills he cannot scale up the value he's bringing   to the world so do i feel some sense of guilt for quitting a job that a lot of people would consider   a dream job definite but to be honest i would feel more guilty if i would have the opportunity   to build a life that i actually want to live but not do so because that would be a true disgrace to   the people that do not even have the opportunity to build a life they want to live although i think   a lot of people have the opportunity to build the life they want to have but do not realize   so because in fact if you're watching this video that means you have a mobile phone a laptop or a   computer and an internet connection and with those things you can learn almost anything you want   online for free that's what i did i didn't go to film school i didn't know anything about   cameras i just watched a lot of youtube videos i learned everything online picked up a camera   some lenses and started creating videos and i'm trying to build a life based on making   videos is it scary 100 but i'm still gonna do it because as i said i think it's scarier to   know that you have the opportunity to create a life you want to have but choose to not do so   and accept this kind of mediocre life where you're surviving instead of thriving now that   sounds a lot scarier to me than just going for it at least trying so if you're still watching that   means you have a mobile phone that means you have a laptop and an internet connection go for it go   figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life and then go do it go get good at it   and build the life you want i know it sounds cliche i'm getting an emotional here i know   it sounds cliche but if i can do it then you can definitely do it i will be sharing my journey my   struggles and my life lessons on this channel i'm glad to have you on this journey with me cheers over the last five years i've learned length i get rewarded rewarded i get rewarded for the amount of   put into creating both videos videos what the [ __ ] i am starting to become danish is it scary   100 percent but i'm still doing it yeah is there doing it see how confident i am \"]), ('gSWxkKXRLbk', [\"Transcriber: Leonardo SilvaReviewer: Ruth

why on earth   someone would leave a career they've spent years building to hop over to something like day trading   something a little bit risky right we see doctors lawyers teachers mechanics dentists you name it   do it all of the time i mean are we absolutely crazy well we might be but aside from that   there are some pretty understandable reasons why a lot of people gravitate towards this industry   let's chat about them but first for those who don't know me or know my background here's a quick   snippet about me i'm a professional chef i've cooked privately in client homes for many years   i started a fine dining pop-up restaurant and i do menu consulting for restaurants and hospitality   groups and there's a decent chance you've seen me on national television so why would someone like   me with a decade spent building a successful career and client roster that has absolutely   no correlation to the stock market whatsoever decide to quit my job to become a day trader   number one there's no ceiling to how much you can make so as an entrepreneur there's typically an   appropriate amount that you can charge a client before it becomes outrageous and they no longer   want to pay for it or they can no longer afford it and with a nine to five like your standard job   there's only so much of a ladder you can climb and so much of a paycheck you can make i really like   not having limits it's very motivating for me plus i've always been a bit of a carver on path kind of   a person and as an added bonus to this not only is there not really a ceiling to how much you can   make but there's also not a lot of overhead so you don't have a lot of staff to pay for   or materials to pay for so your the amount you can make is exponential and the amount you're paying   every month is very very minimal number two it's different every day this isn't the type of job   where you stamp your time card and robotically do the same thing every single day even running   my own business you know where i didn't stamp a time card there were still times that i was   spending back-to-back days doing the exact same thing peeling the same bucket of potatoes cooking   the same dish going to the same client's house and so on and you know now don't get me wrong i do sit   down at my same desk with my same monitors pretty much every day but the market itself is different   so i trade different stocks and the price action is different and there's different news that's   happening like elon musk buys twitter elon musk doesn't buy twitter all these little things and   nuances make each day a unique challenge so if you like a new challenge and you enjoy not doing   the exact same thing every day then i'm sure you'll understand where i'm coming from plus   the learning path is endless there's there are so many different things to learn about the overall   market and strategies that you really can't get bored there's no point at which you say well   i've learned everything i can you'll really never stop learning in this industry and   learning is what keeps our brains alive number three you can do it from literally anywhere   there you know there are certain jobs that you can do remotely and certain jobs that you can't   mine was unfortunately the latter so if i wasn't physically there i was not getting paid   some of my consulting gigs i was able to do from afar but most things were happening in person so   if i went away for a week i couldn't just log in for a couple of hours in the morning do a little   work make some lunch money and carry on with my day instead i basically just didn't get paid and i   love that trading allows me the flexibility to not be chained to one location or even one room in my   house i could just pick my laptop up and go to the kitchen and you know i still get paid and i get   to also continue to be my own boss it's awesome number four the sense of community and growth and   this is a big one for me because before i branched out into the more public eye in the hospitality   world i spend a lot of time in kitchens by myself and so to have people around me that are   like-minded is really just an amazing feeling and on top of that the growth aspect a lot of people   you know in this industry are you know they know that they have to do better to be better they got   to work on their demons so they're all working on themselves sharing ideas and growing together and   i absolutely love that there's you know there's a sense of support and not competition for instance   in a standard career if you got hired and got paid to do a job that position is no longer   available for someone else like if someone hires me to cook for them there's not also they're not   also going to hire another chef the same day so only one of us is going to get paid but in trading   if i make 100 bucks it doesn't mean another trader can't also make 100 bucks because of   this there's absolutely no battling it out for a job or a client everyone in the community   is just sharing ideas bettering themselves growing together and making money number five   it allows me time and flexibility if i want to take a friday off at the last minute i can take   it if i suddenly want to leave town i can leave if something comes up with a family member i can be   there and i just absolutely love the freedom like how could you not love that i mean that   to me is wealth itself like whether i'm making five dollars or a million dollars like the fact   that i have freedom just is it's everything and you know the last one for me personally   and this is just a bonus is that day trading is less physically demanding my god being a chef   is very exhausting my feet man my feet and bonus number two is just just so much damn fun so   whether you choose day trading as a part-time gig or you decide to do it full-time   like myself and many others out there i'm sure we have a lot of things in common but i'd love   to know other reasons why you may have decided to choose this crazy wild ride so drop me a comment   below and let me know and if you liked this video please don't forget to like and subscribe   it helps us

sensitiveand risky to my career\", \"It's always safest to say nothing\", 'But the truth is a lot of toughthings happen to our careers and we rarely talk about it', \"And so the same mistakes getmade over and over again, and it doesn't help anyone\", \"- I was extremely impressedthat Chloe posted this video the day after she quit TikTok, because I've shared with you some things that happened in my career, but I typically wait several years\", \"And she's right, there isa risk to sharing this\", 'So major kudos to Chloe', \"- And let me tell you, I have gone through myfair share of toxic, unbelievable work experiences, and I've never spoken up about them\", \"- Yes, raise your hand ifyou've ever been a part of a toxic work environment\", \"Put 'I've experienced toxic'in the comments of you have\", '- For some context, Ijoined end of last summer as a third PM hire', 'The two PMs before me quit', 'I quickly became the mosttenured PM of the department', 'A lot of things happened, but it ultimately camedown to four main reasons', 'Number one, lack of supportin my career growth', 'How I normally approachthis is that I usually have a formal career development conversation with any new manager that Iwork with in the first month', 'And then I have that conversation every two months after', '- This is something I love', \"I always say that if you are asking for a promotion or a raise, by the time it's time for the official performance conversation or the time that they'rereviewing all compensation, you've waited too long\", 'You want to exactly, as Chloe says, be proactively having these conversations and asking what is thepath to a promotion? What is the path to a raise? - I had many career conversations with the senior leader I was working with, and they were always like, \"Oh yeah, of course I will support you.\" And so two months before aperformance review cycle, I popped the question', 'Do you and the leadershipteam feel confident in nominating me for promo this cycle? They were like, no, youroutput is not enough', 'And I said, can youclarify? What is enough? - This is so important', \"You never want to combatsomeone on something you don't fully understand\", 'So I love that instead of saying, \"Okay, I\\'ll work on my output,\" or saying, \"No, my output\\'s very high,\" she said, \"Can you clarify?\" Love that', '- And in my head I knew I was the highestperformer on the team', 'So where was the disconnect? They said, and let me read this, \"I can not describe whatoutput is the next level because I didn\\'t lookat the leveling rubric', \"I cannot describe the work you need to do because I don't knowit, you should know it, then convince us andexplain why it's important, then launch the project\", 'And when performance review comes, we look at your outcome and see whether you areworthy for promotion.\" - What they\\'re essentiallysaying here is they have no idea what the performance standards are', \"And from what I know aboutTikTok is that they're a company that has grown extremely quickly\", \"And so it's actually not outof the realm of possibility that this would be pretty disorganized\", 'Now when a company saysbasically come up with a case of why we should promoteyou and prove it to us, the issue here is thatthis creates a lot of bias', 'Typically the people whothen make the best case or are perceived withmore leadership qualities, AKA, people with certain backgrounds, characteristics that are more commonly associated with leaders, then those people get the promotion', \"So this is a problematicway of going about this, but that's essentially whatthey're asking for here\", '- \"My last tip to youis don\\'t pay attention to your job level', 'Just do the work.\" I said, I get it', \"I'm all aboutthat entrepreneurial spirit\", 'But leveling is a veryreal topic to discuss', 'Previously at Facebook I hadsponsorship from my manager', \"I got blocked by HRBPbecause of leveling issues, and I just don't want that to happen here\", 'And then they said, without a beat, \"Maybe HR had a differentreason they couldn\\'t tell you', 'Maybe it\\'s that you haven\\'tdemonstrated the capability.\" - It really seems like here, based on the way she\\'s telling the story, that they are really trying to keep her from having this conversation, constantly putting it onher and skirting around the question of how can she get promoted, what steps are there, because they can\\'t really give any proof that she\\'s a low performer', '- Managers were therejust to judge performance', \"They weren't there to lift the teams and elevate them to the next level\", '- Okay, a manager shouldalways be someone who is in service to their employees,to their team members, making sure that they are being effective', \"That's the entire purpose of a manager\", 'Not to judge performance, ooh', '- Number two, culture', 'To give you a sense of what work is like, TikTok is owned by ByteDance, which is a Chinese company that is about over a 100,000 people', \"You might've heard of996 culture from China, which is working 9:00 AM to9:00 PM, six days a week\", '- 996, so brutal', 'I hear so much of this culture these days of be your own boss, leave the nine to five andbecome an entrepreneur', \"But yet what I see so manypeople do is they leave the nine to five, and whenthey're an entrepreneur, it's like a 996, where they're working around the clock to get their own business up and running\", \"This is my little warning to you of we can find jobs that are exciting, that are going to light youup, that aren't draining, that are not going to make you work around the clock like this\", 'Not necessarily goinginto entrepreneurship is always the right way, unless you have a really sustainable way that you can do entrepreneurship', 'So just a quick plug there', \"- I'd have UK meetingsfrom eight to 10:00 AM and then us meetings from 10 to 6:00 PM, and then Beijing meetingsfrom 7:00 PM to like midnight\", 'There was kind of a bizarremeeting culture too', 'About half the time Iwould have one-on-ones, and senior managers wouldbe like 15 minutes late, or they would reschedule the meeting when the meeting was supposed to start', 'I regularly worked around12 to 16 hours a day, and I really questionedwhether or not I could do this should I ever become a mom', \"- So this is an important point here, is that when you werelooking at job opportunities it's so important to notfocus solely on the title, product manager, or the company, TikTok\", \"That's a brand name\", 'I love using their application', \"I'm passionate about their application\", \"That's not enough\", \"You shouldn't necessarily join a company because you're interestedin their product\", 'You actually have to makesure that your company aligns with your values', 'So if one of her values isbeing able to spend time with family and friends andpotentially be a mother someday, this job is in completeopposition to this', \"Make sure that you are notblinded by the shiny names of these companies, and you're being so excited totell your friends and family that you work there when really you're going to bemiserable day in and day out\", '- Outside of the hours, the culture was also a little harsh', \"And I don't mean the lackof happy hours or swag or no meeting days or awards\", 'Culture to me is howpeople treat each other behind closed doors', 'And behind these doorsI saw that people were kind of mean and they got away with it', 'There was this big emergency, and I had a whip togetherthis like insane proposal', \"Ultimately it didn't work out, but I shared my learningswith my core team, which I think is a veryimportant thing to do so this doesn't happen again\", 'Right after I shared, a seniormanager straight up said, \"Let this be a lesson toyou to do your job right,\" publicly in front of 30 people', '- So one thing in the company culture is assuming positive intent', \"So if someone's beingmean to you repeatedly and putting you down andperceiving what you're doing as having the wrong intentions,that's a huge red flag\", \"- I've talked to some ofmy colleagues about this, and apparently there's thisthing called workplace PUA\", 'PUA stands for pickup artist', 'And it comes from how pickup artists use emotionally manipulative language to get people to question their reality andthen take advantage of them', 'When translated to the workplace, it refers to when colleaguesand senior managers attack your character and your identity instead of your professional behavior', \"It's kind of like neggingand sometimes gaslighting\", 'I learned that it washappening to me on a number of occasions and I felt crazy', 'I cried a lot', 'People I thought I shouldhave trusted had said some really hurtful things, and it sucked', \"- Yeah, this is a common thing I've seen with a lot of employees\", 'You are told by peoplewho have higher status, who have maybe have years and years more experience than you, that you are missing a gap,that you are not competent', 'And yes, it can really messwith your sense of self', '- Number three, diversity', 'Big surprise', 'There was a significant lack of women and BIPOC representation in the managerial and leadership roles', \"I mentioned that earlierthat when I do become a mom I wouldn't be able to work here, and I think a lot of peoplehad the same thought\", \"- Okay, so that's a really important point that is made many times over in industries like tech and consulting\", 'One of the best solutionsis to really build a more balanced culture', \"Even if you look at studiesof employee productivity, there's actually a ceiling ofproductivity after a certain amount of hours to whereit's not advantageous to continue working people to the bone\", \"As she said earlier in this video, she was the most tenuredperson on her team and she'd only beenthere for about a year\", 'So that goes to show howmuch turnover there is', \"And it's so much better to have employees for long amounts of

days since I last uploaded more like two and a half years so sorry about that but I figured it's about time for me to   catch you guys on what I've been doing for the last two and a half years and what I'm planning   on doing in the future I graduated from college I got a job as an electrical engineer I moved from   Knoxville and as you can see I bought a ton of shoes so that's that's pretty cool right no but   but seriously I bought all of these so anyway as you can see from the title I've got some pretty   big news and that's that I'm quitting my job and what am I gonna go do well I have decided   to take on a lot of debt and go back to school to get my MBA so just give you guys a little   bit of background on why I'm doing this I guess I need to walk you through the last two half years   since since I haven't posted anything you guys don't know anything about what I've been doing   last two and half years I graduated from college like I already said got a degree in electrical   engineering and you know I always had internships all my internship experiences were good they were   interesting enough but I always felt like something was missing and to be completely   honest with you I felt like being an Indian there was a lot of pressure from the community from just   people at school from myself to be an engineer or be a doctor or be a lawyer or whatever but   to be completely honest with you I felt like I've always been more interested in finance   and money and how the stock market worked and how to invest your money I always tried to do things   like that kind of on my own but I was also kind of embarrassed to admit that and so I just kept   doing the engineering thing and I decided to get a minor in business administration so that way I   could still learn a little bit about the finance side but I was really interested in but I kept too   Engineering thing so as time went on we got into the first semester senior year of college and all   my friends were starting to get job offers from everyone I really didn't know what I wanted to do   and so I thought the natural next progression for me was to get my master's degree in engineering so   I started applying to a bunch of master's programs and I even got into one at the University of Texas   at Austin which at the time was the number nine electrical engineering program in the country   I was interviewing for a bunch of internships that semester and I remember during one of my   interviews one of the interviewers asked me why are you getting a master's degree if you know you   can do the same job and get paid the same amount with just your bachelor's degree I didn't answer   the question I literally stared at this guy for at least 30 seconds mouth open he must have thought   that I was the biggest idiot on earth but to be honest with you I had no idea I knew that I didn't   really enjoy engineering but I just thought it was the right thing to do and like I said a bunch   of my friends were already getting job offers anywhere between like sixty-five seventy five   thousand dollars a year which as a 21 year old at the time that's a lot of money honestly for anyone   that's a lot of money so I kept asking myself why am I going and putting myself more in debt to get   this master's degree when I know engineering doesn't really make me happy and here's this   interviewer who's telling me I can get the same amount of pay with just my bachelor's degree I   had an internship already lined up at the time I called them and I said hey I don't think I'm   gonna come for the internship because instead I'm gonna work full-time I kind of thought that it was   gonna be a bridge burned when I said I wasn't gonna come for the internship but instead they   invited me out they interviewed me they really liked me still so they offered me a full-time   position so my girlfriend and I we packed all of our stuff from Knoxville we moved here to Johnson   City and I started working at Eastman Chemical Cup in kingsport I got this weird vein in my   forehead that I can see on camera and while the experience has been really great um like I said   before it just didn't get me excited I didn't feel like I was doing what I should be doing and I just   had that nagging thought in the back of my mind that man I should be doing something different   at first I thought maybe I just don't like working for a chemical company and so I applied to a bunch   of other jobs I actually got to the last round and a couple of them and when I got invited out   to the headquarters for my final interview I again turned it down because I felt like why am I going   through this process again I know I don't wanted to continue doing engineering I finally took the   leap of faith and I applied to a bunch of MBA programs and after applying all those schools   I got rejection after rejection after rejection and I was really starting to lose hope that I was   gonna go back and get my MBA until finally I got that one acceptance letter you only need one and   I got accepted into University of North Carolina's kenan-flagler Business School now before you think   this was a really easy decision I can tell you it definitely was not you can do a very quick google   search and figure out how much the MBA at UNC costs and if you don't want to I'll just tell   you the entire program cost about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars and that's just tuition   that's not living expenses that's not anything else and we can talk about that stuff in a later   video if you guys want to but yeah it's it's not easy to make that decision and because of copán   19 things have gotten even more complicated with everything going on UNC's already kind of adjusted   what they're doing in terms of their MBA program originally they were supposed to start classes at   the end of July beginning of August now they're gonna be starting at the end of August beginning   of September so we're already losing about a month's worth of just in classroom experience   there they also announced all of their recruiting and networking events are going to be virtual and   so I'm not gonna have that face-to-face contact with recruiters that I was originally planning   on having and this isn't just for UNC either for instance Harvard actually said that they're   gonna have 200 less MBA students this year than they did last year for whatever reason whether   students want don't want to participate in a virtual format maybe international students   couldn't get a visa because of covin or whatever the reason might be so obviously all that makes   this a really difficult decision on the one hand I really want to go back to school follow what   I think is my passion and on the other hand do I want to spend that kind of money to get this   program when it seems like because of kovat and everything that's going on you're not really going   to give that full traditional MBA experience like you would have gotten if you started in   last year or the year before or maybe even if you wait a year and start next year for me right now   I'm still planning on going in the fall because even though the networking and recruiting events   are gonna be virtual I still think having that in-class in-person experience for the academic   side of it will really be worth it and I'm just ready to go ahead and pursue what I think my   passion is so why am I telling you guys this right now and making this video well to be completely   honest with you I've done a lot of research on what I need to do to transition from you know   working as an engineer to going back to school and getting a career in finance and there's a lot of   really good information out there there is but when you go down and specify engineer to MBA or   engineer to finance there's not a lot of stuff there's not really very many articles or videos   or anything really available so I figured hey if I had those questions and I tried to look it up   surely other people have tried to look it up too so maybe I can be the one to record it and put my   experience on here so in the future someone else can look at this and be like oh that's that's a   realistic expectation to have while going through this experience of going from engineer to NBA and   hopefully I'll be posting a lot more soon so if you guys want to stay updated on that and what I'm   gonna be doing in preparation for my MBA how it goes and all that stuff please make sure to like   this video and subscribe to the channel so you don't miss anything

I put my head down and I kept working', ' But I kept making videos', 'Those videos are what brought me so much joy in such a dark part of my life', \"I’m showered, clean, ready now it's time to explore\", 'And this is the star of the show our little Portuguese pup, Bella', \"And then I came up with the project and that's when I knew it had to happen\", 'I needed to quit', \"  Now I didn't just quit without any backup plans, this was months of me thinking, considering,  talking to a lot of different people about whether this is a smart thing, these are  some of my options, this is what i'm thinking\", \" I'm not just going into this new life, this new chapter without anything\", \"  It's hella scary because I'm in the middle of this transition right now and I don't know what's going to happen\", 'This project could be the beginning of a completely  new fruitful, fulfilling, purposeful chapter of my life, or it could be just one of those things where yeah you f****d up, move on', ' It could be one of those too', \"I don't know,  but the thing is, is i'm willing to find out\", \"This new project has so many different branches that I'm so pumped for every single part of it\", \"  And I'm so excited that we're going to do this together\", \"  Oh my god I'm actually going to say this on camera\", \"I'm actually going to tell you\", '  I can tell you the biggest part of the project', 'Starting from the next video you see on this channel I am going to climb or walk or snowmobile or ski to the highest peak in every European country', ' Every country on the European continent has its highest peak, obviously, some are pretty mighty like Mont  Blanc or Mount Elbrus and some are just like this tiny little hill which is a little bit sad', 'The reason this project excites me so much is because in a lot of these countries these peaks are in some pretty strange places', '  I have never been to any of the highest peaks except for one, the Vatican', ' So that means I get to revisit all of these countries  with you and there are going to be so many new places to experience', \"I don't know if you can see  me shaking, it's quite cold out right now but I’m shaking because I'm so excited and I'm so nervous\", 'I quit my job to follow my heart, to have purpose, be me', \" I don't even know if I'm really going to add this in the video, but it's kind of how I'm feeling right now\", \" With the state  how the world nowadays, I don't know what the future holds and so that's why I want to take my life into my own hands and make my own adventure\", \"    I can't wait any more it needs to happen that's why it is happening\", \"Oh, god, I'm so cold\", '']), ('YmnlrK2l-7U', ['What is up everyone, welcome back to my channel', \"In today's video, I'm actually going to begoing over the two books and the three podcasts that really helped me gain that courage andthe confidence that I so desperately needed when I was going through the decision of quittingmy corporate job\", 'Now the reason why I made this video is becauseI first hand understand what a big decision this is and how scary and lonely it can be', \"During this phase your life, you don't reallyhave that many people or mentors to talk to\", \"And that's why for me during that period ofmy life, I turned my attention a lot to podcasts and books, in order to find the inspirationthat I desperately needed and that guidance, in order to figure out if leaving my job wasactually the right decision for me or not\", \"So the first book that really changed my lifeis Tim Ferriss's Four Hour Work Week\", 'Now this book is extremely detailed, and ittalks about a wide range of topics, including how we live our lives and how we operate inlife and business', \"I definately don't want to ruin the book incase you want to read it, so I'm only going to give you the two key takeaways that I receivedfrom this book, that specifically helped my way of thinking and gave me the confidenceand the inspiration that I needed to pull the plug\", 'The first take away is that this book reallyhelped me change my perception on wealth', \"And it taught me that it's not just moneythat makes someone wealthy, but it's time as well\", 'And how we use that time is a huge determinanton whether we live a rich life or a poor life', \"Something that specifically struck me withthis book is that he asks you; Would you rather spend the next 40 to 50 years working in arat race environment that you don't even like, only to get three week vacations per year,and to retire at 65\", \"And then, once you retire finally use thelast 20 to 25 years of your life to enjoy what's left? Or, would you rather spend the next yearsof your life working on something everyday that truly doesn't feel like work, that trulydoesn't feel like you need a break from? And so this example specifically really openedmy eyes to how many people in this world actually use up so many of their glory years workingon things that they don't love, going to jobs that they hate, only to retire at 65 and enjoywhat's left\", \"But the problem is that by the time you're65, your body and your mind are not going to be as youthful as it is right now\", 'And by being so scared of this concept iswhat really motivated me to start now', 'Yes, it might take a while to find my truepassion', 'Yes, it might take a while to make a livingout of something that I love doing', \"But I'd rather spend the next five, 10 yearsdoing that, than spend the next 40 years working on something that I already know is not forme\", \"The second major take away from Tim Ferriss'sbook is that it taught me the importance and the power of being an owner versus an employee,or even being a boss\", 'For example, what he says in the book is thatmany people in this world strive to either be an employee or a boss', 'But truly rich and wealthy people, they aspireto be owners', 'How Tim Ferriss really illustrates this isbasically, think about a train', 'Would you rather be the employee that workson the train serving the food, or manning the tickets, or, the boss that actually hasto make sure that the train runs on time', 'Or, would you rather be the owner of the actualtrain and have the employee and the boss do the work for you, and making sure that thetrain is operating well? I think that once Tim Ferriss really brokedown these examples between truly wealthy people versus average people, it really litup this entrepreneurial bug inside of me, and inspired me so much to do my own thingand to strive to be an owner, not just in business, but also in my life', 'And so before I move on to the next book,I also want to give a lot of credit to Tim Ferriss', 'I think Tim Ferriss played a huge role inmy journey of leaving the rat race and starting my own business', 'Other books that he has are also extremelyexcellent', 'He has a book called Tools of Titans, andalso Tribe of Mentors', 'Essentially, in a nut shell, those two booksfeature over 100 of the worlds top performers, and each section of the book, really digsdeep into the philosophies of these people, their lifestyle, their habits', 'And these people also give their businessand financial advice in these books', 'And so by reading these books that also openedmy mind to what was truly possible in my life, and also gave me a tribe of mentors and atribe of people that I may not know, but really coached me through this time in my life', \"The second book that I want to give a shoutout to is Danielle Laporte's Desire Map\", 'This book really helped me be more in tunewith my intuition, and gave me the inspiration to follow my gut, and to lead a life thatis more intentional', \"Essentially what Danielle Laporte teachesin the Desire Map is that, a lot of times, a lot of people, we set goals based on materialobjects, material items, material experiences, just external things that don't necessarilyreally mean anything\", \"Because at the end of the day, yes, we'retrying to chase these external goals, but what we're really searching for is the feelingthat we hope we'll get by attaining these goals\", \"For example, let's say one of our goals isto have a six figure salary\", \"But really, what that truly means is thatby having that six figure salary, what we're really hoping for is that we hope to feelvalidated, we hope to feel powerful, we hope to feel a sense of freedom\", \"These three feelings are really what we'relooking for, not just the six figures, not just the money\", \"It's really what that money will actuallybring us into how we feel about ourselves and our lives\", 'So essentially in a nut shell, what this bookreally taught me is to set goals not just based on external things like, starting myown business, being on Forbes 30 under 30, or being a VP of whatever company', 'It really taught me to set goals based onthe feelings that I want to achieve in my life', 'For instance, the major three goals that Ihave in my life is to feel alive', \"It's to feel purposeful, and it's also tofeel creative\", 'And when I actually narrow down these threefeelings that I want to achieve in my life, I realized that the job I was doing in myprevious Fortune 500 company, none of those things I was doing in my day-to-day job actuallymade me feel alive, purposeful nor creative', \"And that's when I knew that there was a hugemisalignment between what my actual goals were, and what I wanted in my life, versuswhat I was doing right now\", 'It also allowed me to tap into what I trulywanted and understanding my why for doing thing', 'Not only all of these things, it also helpedme find careers or find opportunities that would actually make me feel good, that wouldactually make me feel more alive, more purposeful, and more creative', 'Now onto podcasts', 'During that time in my life when I was questioningwhether or not to leave my job, podcasts were a life saver', 'I think that that was the time in mu lifewhere I listened the most podcasts shows actually', 'And I would spend all my mornings while Iwas doing my make up listening to episodes', \"Even during my commute to work, I would belistening to podcasts, or as I was walking home after work, I'd be listening to podcasts\", 'And so podcasts, really changed the way thatI consume content', \"It also gave me inspiration that I didn'treally know I needed\", \"The first podcast that really changed thegame for me is a podcast called, Don't Keep Your Day Job, by Cathy Heller\", 'This podcast is literally perfect for anyonewho is contemplating leaving their job', \"This whole podcast's focus is basically forpeople who are in this stage in their lives\", 'What I love most about this podcast is notonly does Cathy Heller interview people who have quit their jobs and followed differentpaths in their lives, but she also introduces experts onto the show to actually talk aboutthe psychology of leaving, advice that they would give', \"It's not just fluffy stuff, it's actual tangiblestuff that might help you and inspire you to take to leap yourself\", \"For anyone who is considering leaving theirjobs or needs such inspiration or needs that advice, I highly recommend Cathy Heller'sDon't Quit Your Day Job podcast\", \"The second podcast that indirectly basicallyhelped me quit my job is NPR's How I Built This\", \"I think a lot of people know this podcast,it's a very popular one, but I can't stress enough how amazing this podcast truly is\", \"If you don't know this podcast, essentially,each episode actually focuses on the founders of some of the world's biggest companies\", 'But not only do they talk about business orentrepreneurship and everything like that, but what I love most about this podcast isthat it really focuses on the story', 'On the journey of the founder before theyeven got successful', 'And I think that that is what makes this podcastamazing, because you can actually see the struggles that these entrepreneurs went through', 'The risks that they had to take, their backstory, the decisions, their set backs, their failures, everything', \"I think that this podcast, very similar toTim Ferriss's book, is what truly ignited that entrepreneurial bug inside of me\", 'But also what this podcast did is, give methe courage to relentlessly chase after my dreams and to not give up and to have thatpersistence', 'Because as I was listening to all the episodes,one of the key things that all these successful founders have is persistence, and also a veryclear vision not backing down on that vision', \"And so, NPR's How I Built This, is a greatpodcast if you want that daily dose, or that weekly dose of inspiration of how other peoplehave made a living doing what they love and fighting for what they want in their lives\", 'Last but not least, the third podcast thatreally gave me the courage to ditch the nine to five', 'And that is the Kelly Track Show', 'Kelly Track is actually a boss babe that Iwas lucky enough to go to university with', 'When she launched the podcast, I listenedto many of her episodes', 'A lot of her episodes, especially in the earlierstages of her podcasts, really focused on her journey, and her mindset of how she tookthe leap in order to pursue entrepreneurship, and how she took the leap to let go of SiliconValley, and how she took the leap to let go of corporate', 'She has done a lot of cool things in her lifeand her story is incredibly inspiring', 'One of my favorite episodes of hers on thepodcast is an episode called, \"Quitting is Underrated.\" I\\'ll link the show in my description in thisvideo, because I truly think that if you are someone who has a lot of anxiety about howpeople will label you if you quit because trust me, I had that', \"I was so scared of being called a quitter,I didn't want that to ruin my reputation, I just didn't want people to think that Ijust gave up and I'm not a good worker, that I'm not a hard worker\", 'This episode really changed my perspectiveon why quitting is actually okay', \"Kelly's podcast is also great if you wantto tap into the spiritual side of you\", \"I think that Kelly's podcast really kind ofgot my feet wet into law of attraction, manifestation, the universe, finding alignment in your life\", 'I think that her podcast is a great resourceif you wanted to get your feet wet into that of spirituality', \"And if you don't, that's totally okay\", 'She has some episodes, especially the onesthat are pertaining to her story, how she took the leap', 'They are incredibly inspirational, and I highly,highly could not recommend it anymore than I already have', \"That's it guys\", 'Those were the two books and the three podcaststhat truly changed the way that I saw my journey', 'And truly changed my perspective on quitting,and leaving and a job that was no longer serving me', 'I hope that by watching this video, you decideto pick up one of the books, or take a listen to one of the podcasts and I ope it changesyour life too', \"And if not, then I hope that you don't giveup on this journey to find your true life's purpose\", 'If you need any help with that, then feelfree to drop a comment, private message me', \"This is my Instagram, so you can always messageme if you want, I'm here to help\", \"That being said, I hope you guys have an amazingday, I hope you guys have an amazing week, I hope you guys have an amazing life, andI'll see you in the next one\", 'Bye', '']), ('jxNlGHvOLmM', [\"before i didn't have the time because all i had to do was point at corporate   y'all the problem okay it wasn't them it's me hi ladies and gentlemen and everybody in between i'm back   for another vulnerable get ready with me clink clink clink we're back for another get ready with me and i'm super duper duper excited because   this was a little bit different we're going to be doing obviously my get ready with me always are   like a two in one we do a wig we do makeup now the wig the hair y'all see this hair i love this bomb   i have to be honest when i first saw it i was like hmm how is this going to look on me cute it's cute   girl the way the way this wig came is it really is pull it out the box and go sort of weak the   face is an all-stick foundation sort of look so very much giving oh very much giving skin you see   wow this get ready with me is it perfectly links with this week now let me tell you something   i have been on youtube for seven years i have been doing wig reviews for seven years in all   seven of those years this wig brand is has been one of my gold brands to work with   i i don't know why i feel like i'm about to cry again why am i so emotional today oh   i already know you already know what time it is i felt like if i worked with this brand i made it   i want to say thank you to rpg hair for providing this wig to me and sponsoring this portion of this   video i'm so elated to do this wig review and they did not disappoint i've been on youtube for seven   years and i quit my job nine months ago to be a full-time youtuber and social media influencer   and in this get ready with me we're going to chat about how it's been going so far and   just some advice that i've learned since quitting my job so because how many months did i say it's   been a whole gestational period girl it's been nine months i have a few little tips just from   little on me girl don't don't be acting like grass little on me i don't know nothing if you want to   see a little bit more information about this beautiful hair and you want to get a coupon code   a coupon code with my name on it girl i've arrived please keep on watching and i'll be back   let's get into some girl top and do this face now let's go ahead and pop this box open your wig   comes in the rpg hair wig box inside that box of course these are the gifts i received a baby hair   brush a rat tail comb some flyaway balm and an elastic bag band that you're able to remove and of   course a service card now of course this is your wig this is the ombre bob curly lace frontal wig   it is 14 inches long 180 density and this hairline is giving friend look at this hairline it has a   bleach hairline hd lace and a clean hairline which means it's pre-plucked and ready to go flattened   for you friend so we're gonna do our ball cap method now my ball cap method ain't your ball cap   method we got different ball cap methods because my ball can't mess at me i don't do nothing girl   you probably gonna see my recap through this but we're gonna fix it towards the end so i just do a   wig grip as well as a wig cap over it and that's it but as you can see this hairline is giving so   i'm gonna use some lace tint um the lace is hd but i always like to tip my lace i use the calendar   lace tint and i just spray it down and blow dry it with a blow dryer on warm to set in   the color now look at it now it looks real good it's going to melt into the skin very very well   but the first thing i need to do is re-flatten the hairline because when i blow dry it just be   freezing the thing up so we need to get this thing back where she needed to be so i'm going to use my   andes hot comb just to go ahead and lay her down a bit and get her re-flattened to her original state so look at that it look real pretty it looks really really flat and all i need to do is cut off   this lace girl we are halfway there so when i'm cutting off my lace i like to use my annie shears   and i'm just going to pull back the hair just so i don't chop off a whole side of my wig and now   i got an asymmetrical wig i don't want that so i just clip the hair back and i'm going around   the ears and i'm cutting off a little bit of the hair on the side because it hangs over my ears a   little bit so i got a tiny head so y'all know the caps a little bit bigger also cut some of   the hair off the front as well so in order to apply the wig we're going to use the wig dealer   spray now this wig dealer spray is amazing if you haven't tried her i would say try her out   i'll leave a link for it down below but it gets real real sticky and we're gonna do two   layers of the wig dealer spray we're just gonna lay this wig down   and y'all watch as my scalp trim okay let me get my words right watch as my scalp transforms   transforms what am i going through so i'm going to use the back of the rat tail comb just to   go ahead and melt that in a little bit this was super super duper easy to apply but to make sure   this lace actually melted melted down i spray over the lace just to make sure   nothing is lifting up and we're completely melting into the skin and i want y'all to look at these it   looks so good now you know i wouldn't be me if i do no little teeny tiny little infant hairs   on my wig so i like for my baby hairs to be really tiny and instead of using gel to lay them down   because that's what i used to do i'm going to use the wig dealer spray now this is a little   bit harder but it gives a much softer look and let me tell you something the way they pre-plug   this wig it makes the baby hairs look so natural now you know that you got a good pre pluck wig   when your baby hairs are really really fine and they look super natural and i like mine to look   you know like more like just edges and less like baby hairy because they just don't be   looking right on my forehead so i like to do four sets of baby hairs i only like to   do bow i would like to just do two on the ear tabs and then two like basically on my temples   one thing i like about doing baby hairs on the ear tabs is it stops the ear tabs from popping up as   much so as you can see that has been laid down and all we have to do is melt it into the hairline i   like to use and what do you call this elastic band just to lay it down and get it really really flat   next we're going to do this hair now one thing i noticed about this hair is because it is colored   it seems like it's a little bit drier so we needed to add a little moisture in this thing   just to get this hair going now you can wear this hair right out of the box but y'all know me   i always got to do a little bit too much just to get a little bit out of it so i'm going to use my   shea moisture mousse just to go ahead and apply the mousse to the hair and encourage these curls   to keep going so i'm going to use my evol 572 brush and i'm just going to brush through the hair   just to make these curls clump together and encourage the curls to look less more like less   like machine curls and more like natural curls if you know what i mean so i'm using the coconut   curls what was this called um what i call it it's the coconut curls ors ogx ogx coconut curls   dry cream i don't think i should have used that on this hair i should have just left it with the   mousse but you know i always do too much so i'm just going to continue using the mousse   and comb through the hair with my 572 brush just to clump together the curls at the top i started   doing some finger coiling just to encourage the curls to clump together a little bit more   and you couldn't see it but i was trimming off the ends this bob seemed more asymmetrical y'all   know i'm not asymmetrical girl i'm a straight bob sort of girl so i decided to just clip off   the ends on the front a little bit just so this is a more of this is more of an even   bob so i can get more fullness if you know what i mean you see oh it's going to be so   cute now i'm going to go ahead and use my dyson blow dryer and i'm just going to diffuse   this hair dry now i diffused on really really high heat because girl was brushing i was trying   to hurry up and get this dry because drying curly hair does take a minute especially when you clump   the curls together so i dried it in about maybe 30 minutes and after that i wanted to   reveal the hairline and look at that hairline baby it is melted the only thing i need to do   was cover up that cap i used my stick foundation in nc50 just to cover up the cap that's showing   up around the baby hair parts um and that did a pretty good job now you can kind of see it but   if you too close girl back up give me 50 feet you don't need to be that close we just flattened the   middle part and that's it girl we didn't have to do much now if you do the ball cap method   girl you were in there like swimwear i don't know if anybody says that anymore but you are in there   now now we can go ahead and separate the curls as you can see they're fully clumped together and   that's just how i like it now a couple of them were still wet i probably should have let them   dry a little bit longer but girl my patience was wearing then so i did separate the curls   now i could still tell that i probably needed oil or something to moisturize the ends because   it still felt a little bit drier but once i separated the curls and fluffed the hair out   this was the look and i'm telling you i was obsessed my husband loved it i was walking   around like girl this is me this is my hair so if you would like to purchase this wig i'll   leave a link for it down below i'll also leave my coupon code for ten dollars off down below it   is a mirror bob for ten dollars off now let's go ahead and get into doing this natural face okay y'all let's get started with doing the face the hair is done we got ourselves a cute little   curly bob now we can go ahead and get started with the face and what do i want to talk about i want   to give an update on leaving my job why am i so nervous but i want to give you all an update on   leaving corporate for social media i left my job in october it is august july august it's been nine   months it's been a full gestational period and a lot of things have grown and changed   and i wanted to give y'all like just like a little update how that was going because whoo the face   that i'm gonna do is mostly like stick foundations this is a uh foundation routine that i used   to do when i went into the office let me start with one of my bases already moisturized i use   almost all origins products because my face has been going through it friend   i had a breakout after coming back from vegas and it took me forever to get rid of those bumps on my   forehead but as you can see they're gone and basically i had to stop using vitamin c okay   y'all know i like to use a headband to get the hair out the way now we can go ahead and   start with the base for the face now i'm gonna use the unseen sunscreen super goop   spf it feels like a um primer oh my face is greasy i probably should have removed some of that grease   because my face is green see that's okay on top of this um super goop unseen sunscreens   i'm gonna use the nyx bear with me prime set and refresh eight hour hydration spray i wonder if why do i make that face let me make it cuter okay so while my face dries down   i'm gonna tell y'all what i'm gonna use for the face and i'm just gonna go ahead and apply it   i'm gonna use the bobbi brown stick foundation in golden skin for under the eyes to highlight   for bronzing i'm going to use the the bobbi brown walnut skin foundation stick as a contour and then   for like the areas of my face that just need some correcting i'm going to use the   mac studio fix soft matte stick foundation in the color nc 50\", \"i already talked about why i   left corporate so i was in corporate for about eight years i'm gonna start oh girl that's luck don't tug at the skin and i left because first i have been doing youtube for i think   six years and it's been i've always had to balance doing youtube and working   so i left because well girl it was a lot of work to do both and eventually i started making more   doing this and i was stopping myself from making money working full-time then you know versus you   know going into the office making an hourly pay doing as much work as i was doing i was remote so   i was working from home but even then i couldn't i couldn't balance the two i think it's hard to   explain how much work it is not only to be a social media influencer but somebody that does   wigs it just takes a lot more labor and wigs was my main promotion so when i started doing youtube   i started it back in what 2015 was it 2015 yes it was 2015\", \"when i started doing wigs so back   then um i mean i knew i could get uh i could get paid off of youtube but i didn't know how much   it was and i still was on a path of having a career and being a clinical mentor counselor   and still working in corporate and entertaining that as well so i was thinking like i've always   had multiple jobs i was always doing that so i was thinking like oh i could do this for a minute i   could balance working incorporate in doing youtube and going to school at that time to get my master   masters but eventually i stopped going to school and then eventually i chose to leave   corporate which is the best choice i ever made because girl things are going great   that's what i need to get back to girl was going on and on let's go ahead and blend this   with the sonia kashuk sponge i think for me leaving corporate was the best choice i ever made   because first i'm a much happier person i'm gonna tell y'all right now i was   up i was my attitude was terrible working in corporate it was bad um i'm sorry to   to the people that i knew i was happy unhappy and corporate i'm a person that likes control   and there was little to no control working in corporate you can try and work your way up the   ladder but you can get into a position think it's going to be one thing and then it ends up being   something else and the next thing you know you are stressed out you're tired and you're stuck so   for me i didn't like that so i ended up when i left it was the best choice i made   i was immediately much calmer my anxiety went down all of that now i've been doing this for   what seven years doing youtube for seven years but now that i'm doing it full time i've noticed a   couple things i love doing youtube but i will say this i think what i think one thing that people   make it seem like is doing social media is soft life you know what i'm saying like no   if i think being successful in social media especially as a black woman is um a little   bit more complicated especially on what you do but i think the amount of labor that is expected   of black women is much higher i'm just going to say it i think the way social media the social   media landscape is now especially on youtube there's so many people doing that work that   they almost have to people have to find you so if you are looking into um doing youtube or doing um   anything social media i do think you know you do have to keep in mind that this is not   something that is guaranteed you just won't have one video that pops off   that's very rare that it happens i didn't have a video that popped off that was like okay   i'm here i made it now i can quit my job if you quit your job as soon as you uh pop off on social   media i think it's a terrible idea i there are some people that say like oh yeah you should do it   chase it you know when you get successful when you have a viral video just go   no i think social media is i'm running my mouth and i hope all of this makes sense   i think social media is an amazing tool to use to get to where you need to be but i would say invest   a lot of time research all of that before you choose to do this full-time because it is not easy   and it's not consistent that's one thing that i've learned i've known that that's why i kept my job   all these years i'm gonna add a little bit more coverage under my eyes i've kept my job because   i you know as a woman in my 30s i wasn't looking for instant great i'm looking for stability so   stability was important to me and if if i didn't have stability and consistency i wouldn't have   quit my job it just wouldn't have happened i held on probably much longer than i needed to if you   were looking to be a social media influencer keep your job invest your time or con consistently do   both find time to do both and be realistic with the time that you have commit to your job do well   at your job because you never know what can happen i'm gonna use uh the mac nc50 foundation i just   put it on the flat part of the sponge and i'm just pressing it in how it's going right now is   great but i right now because i'm trying to find a schedule i'm trying to find a schedule on how to   when to upload stuff like that i don't even do as much as some of these other girls do and i'll be   trying to figure out how do y'all find the time but i literally work six and a half days a week   no days off ever not one and if i take a day off girl it messes up everything um social media   is a machine that requires you to engage with it as much as possible to get the best output to get   the best growth to get youtube recommendations uploading three times a week and being consistent   is really really really really really important you don't have to but i do think it's recommended   to at least do once a week but like depending on your type of content my type of content i   have to do like three times a week so far this is looking good friend i'm adding a little bit   more um contour around the nose i'm gonna add some contour on the eyelids because i'm not trying to   do eyeshadow um like i said i've been doing this for seven years and i didn't chase getting   subscribers i'm gonna tell y'all something right now oh let me get my power if you chase subscriber   count you're gonna be selling yourself short i'm gonna use the laura mercier um translucent   powder i think this is too light for my skin tone but i'm gonna use it anyway i'm gonna use   it to set under my eyes and around the mouth but i think people set themselves up by trying to chase views and subscribers views are important but i think what's most important is um   finding a subject matter that you like that you can see that a population cares about   so if you're gonna start a youtube channel like for me i've always loved wigs i've worn wigs   since i was 18 years old so this was organic to me um so coming on youtube and doing wigs was like   it's because i loved it i still had my first video on this channel   i just did a wig video because i found a cute wig and i wanted to tell you all about it and then i   followed it up like with more videos about hair that i loved um oh i need to go into the question   that the girl asked me because it connects to this i the question was asked in my q a   about any tips for micro influencers what does she ask okay so it was kiana h they answered this   question and i promised you i was gonna answer this question she asked i'm curious about how   you went about securing wig collaborations with various companies i can see that a lot of time   hard work and editing goes into your youtube videos without giving away any industry secrets   what's the process like when you're being sponsored by a company versus just putting out   your own youtube content so first um i didn't start wigs for sponsor content until maybe   let's say years years into doing youtube i can't even remember the amount of time but i've been   doing sponsor content for five years how it started was i was doing wig reviews for free   i think mine started with uh like synthetic wig videos and then i moved on to um like human hair   videos and i think my first video i got paid like 50 or something like that for a sponsorship and   how it started was i started with first buying my own wigs i was spending all of my husband's   money there was a point in time where i quit all of my jobs and i was like real sad at home and uh   i think i had a part-time job at this time i was spending money on wigs to do reviews on them so   i spent money on hair anyway like that was always girl when i was in school it was uh y'all remember   you get your check from school from your your loan refund and i would spend my money on hair okay   and then i would come to youtube and i would do reviews on it eventually brands if you leave your   information on your page wig brands will reach out to you okay even the ones on amazon that were   like hey if you do a review i will i've never done that before because i i don't like that um   but they'll reach out to you and say hey do you want to do a review for free and i'll send you   free hair i was happy with that because girl was spending so much money on hair so i started doing   that and then after that i think i had one wig brand that reached out to me and was like hey   you know well i finally gave them a rate and they paid it no 75 dollars i think that was my first   wig review was like 75 bucks my blush be blushing baby oh my god why don't y'all tell me this is   too much yeah i started off doing that and then once they started reaching out to me   basically the wig brands start to reach out to you you also cause i've seen gina jeanine say this   you can reach out to those brands yourself you see a brand you say hey if you send me   some free hair once you start to get a following maybe 500 1000 subscribers   you can start reaching out to them we're just saying hey i'll do it for free   because once you do it for free other brands will see you now there's a certain point where you   you start to get taken advantage of um and you have to figure out where that is based   on your analytics and your engagement and all that type of stuff you can see whether or not   you're not getting enough out of it and you should start charging a rate you can basically start   seeing that by how many people are reaching out to you like if you get a lot of people reaching   out to you then it's like okay i need to start charging a fee that's how you go from free to like   getting paid she asked what's the process like when you're being sponsored by a company versus   putting out your own youtube content when i do my reviews i'd like to give y'all as much information   as possible so you can figure out whether or not you want to purchase it i'm not trying to   sell it to you okay i just want you to know like this is what the wig is like this is what you get   as you can see i'm very detailed in my reviews the only thing that is a different process is writing   down all the information that the brand wants me to say it's usually all the details for the wig   and if they're promoting like a certain part of the week like if it's clear lace   if it's this if it's that then i'll have to let y'all know that type of stuff but other than that   there really girl that isn't really much of a difference i do think i have more fun with   doing my own wig reviews because i only have to think about what i want to do not what the   brain wants which is you know also important you also because you're working with somebody   so there really isn't really much of a different process like i have my notes in front of me   for this week i also have notes for like the other ways that i review so it's kind of like   i've noticed for me when i'm working with brands there isn't they don't have like a lot of requests   there isn't really there isn't any industry secrets wig reviews or wig reviews child really   is no you could see that most people do their wig reviews the same way for me um especially with my   full dedicated wig reviews that are just about the wigs i tried to be so detailed it is painful   those videos take four to six hours to film because i try and like show y'all beginning to   end what the hair is like so it takes like four to six hours like a video like this will take about   from beginning to end let's see i started at 11 it's now 2 35 so this will take about four hours   the other one would take about six like it's four to six it'd be taking a long time already with   these wig videos the great ain't for the faint of heart what was i about to say did i get far off   subject i think i go back to what was i talking about i can't see i need a i need a rubric or i   need to do something or nothing at all because i can't be i don't know what i'm talking about okay   so i'm gonna go ahead and set the face using the lip bar um palette i'm gonna set this is the boss   moves palette i'm gonna use this blush in this bronzer to set the face i wonder if i want to   use this or like the honeymoon powder i use this because it's quicker so let me use my blush first this is pretty i do think um i do want to like for those of you that are looking to be to quit   your job and be influencers um like i said take your time and research the business side don't   just research doing um youtube and how much money you can make it's all about what's the business   what is working with brands whatever brand you whatever business you want to get into if you   do want to do sponsorships because not everybody just sponsorships you can be a commentary channel   whatever you want to do research the business side if you're looking to make a living   getting paid off adsense girl ain't gonna do it adsense is basically like the ads on your video   most people don't make money off that i would say like if you're looking to do collaborations and   sponsorships look into figuring out like what lane can you be in what brands can you work with if   your lifestyle what are you open to working with what do you like what you don't like what makes   you unique all that type of stuff also for the businesses on the business side figure out like   writing how to write an email to a brand how to pitch yourself and also how to create a media kit   that's really really important all that stuff i do think   on your journey to becoming full-time i think it's important to verse yourself in that even if you   get to a point where you blow up and you're like okay i want to hire somebody to manage me you want   to know how they're going to be doing their job so you can look over them because people get screwed   over by management all the time and sometimes you can do that stuff yourself because i did   mine by myself for many many years many many many years i know a lot of people say do what you like   i'm gonna disagree with that but with a little bit i'm gonna disagree with just doing what you   like i think doing what you like is important but i also think researching doing what you like is   important so research if you like to make coffee like what type of coffee videos are really really   popular you can do that within your range of things that you like to do find your audience   like people say your audience will find you they don't always find you because social media is very   very saturated and there's a lot of people that do what you do but you want to make sure what   you do is different from what they're doing you know what i'm saying so your audience not   only you're finding them but they're finding you you're meeting each other you're becoming soul   mates find your niche but then look up like what what are people looking up within my niche like   are people looking up how to make certain types of coffee you know what i'm saying like what is their   favorite sort of coffee can i recreate this or whatever i do think it's important to do research   i think just doing youtube off of vibes or doing social media off of vibes if you have a goal of   being doing it full time and making a living off of it i think it requires um more research   i'm putting on my earrings from amazon i think it requires more research do it to find your audience   and then go from there what was a motivator for me in the beginning of doing social media   and doing youtube people don't watch your videos when you put up your first second third video that   is amazing you do not want nobody watching your first video because most likely it's gonna be bad   you don't want nobody watching you for your first video you want to be able to get those jitters out   talking to the camera is like it's a skill that you have to kind that i've i personally had to   hone in if i keep my first videos up for a reason if you watch my first videos i was like stiff in   front of the camera because it's like you're talking to a camera and it doesn't feel like   you don't even know your audience like i know some of y'all now so it feels like i'm talking to y'all   did i already put on my bronzer it feels like i'm talking to y'all so i feel like i have an audience   like i know that i'm talking to y'all when you're on youtube and you're talking to nobody it when i   was talking to nobody it was weird it was scary and i was thinking like if somebody finds me oh   my god i look so stupid you get in your head but those first videos are for you to get comfortable   like get comfortable sit down talk to the camera become one with seeing yourself on   camera and seeing yourself on screen i'm gonna do my brows i already did my brows y'all know i'll be   doing my brows before i get on camera it was way too dark but now i'm gonna go ahead and color them   in just a little bit more i'm gonna do the i'm gonna use the espresso micro brow pencil right   here and one thing i will say is i'm gonna get to the emotional side one thing that i learned that   i did was i started to i need to put some powder because my eyebrows is oily friend i'm gonna put   some um powder on my eyebrows one thing that i did and i still do i i'm not i do compare it myself to   people on youtube like they're growth i have been doing this for seven years if i wasn't centered   and i didn't live in reality i feel like i would be upset about where i am or be like man why   why why am i not further because i did have that moment where i felt defeated and i felt like man   you know like nobody's watching but i first had to look around at the community that i have and   be appreciative of the community that i have also i had to see like this is exactly what i wanted   where i was at the time is what i wanted to be right now and where i am right now i'm so   elated about like i'm elated where i am i'm happy to have this community i love how we communicate   i do things i'm doing things my way and i'm happy about it so don't compare yourself to other people   because you're you and being you is the best part of having a presence on social   media because you get to be yourself in front of other people and i love that people love   me for me and not me because of her you know what i'm saying my hand is shaking i hope you   all care about this subject because i don't know i'm just running my mouth my journey here on   youtube right now i can say i do not have a social life at this time   i was up this morning thinking about it like oh my god like i don't spend time with my friends   i haven't seen my family in a long time like it's just been me working and sometimes i wonder like   am i making the right choice um doing this and i think i have a struggle finding balance but that's   always been my struggle i've always worked more than i've socialized which is not healthy at all   and i'm trying i need to go to therapy for that because i've always had like an anxiety around   not having money so i always would work like crazy didn't matter what was going on girl i was   going to work i had one moment where i had like a depressive breakdown and i didn't work for like   six months like i literally laid in bed um for a long time so grateful for my amazing husband but   i did have a breakdown because i had done this so long i'm so afraid of getting back to that place   so i need to slow down i thought that my level of exhaustion came from having the job i had   what i realized having the job that i love is that it's not the job grows me it's me i got a   problem i haven't i have an anxiety around money that i need to work through um and being a person   being an independent person and i struggle with feeling like i don't like depending on anybody i   don't like needing people which is probably why i don't have girl i'm over here having cow flavoring   always have wanted to just need myself why am i gonna cry needs to go to therapy y'all know i'll be crying though so this ain't new here if you've been here   before you know i'll be crying i'm gonna use the contour making bets from lip balm i'm just gonna   use it on the eyes but you know what i'm saying like i miss my relationships and i just need to   find a way to consistently you know i don't even know if we keep this in here because i just need   to find a way to consistently uh get back to that and i think when i went to therapy before   my therapist had told me like you're in your 30s that is normal even though it's normal i don't   i don't want it to be my norm i notice i am much happier when i have a community around me and but   consistently doing it is hard for me when i'm always like i can work i can work i can work i   can work i can work i'm trying to get to the money but that's what i've i've learned more   about myself because i think sometimes i think sometimes we can think like   if i had this job or if i could do this that i would be happier or i would feel more fulfilled   i've learned that i thought that was it and that ain't it friend i need to learn balance   i do think it has like me finding my career that i love has opened up has opened up me   thinking like oh it's not what you do it's who you are girl you need to go back to therapy you   need to work out your uh traumas but what doing this has helped me to see myself more i do have   more time to spend time with myself to think to investigate to question how i think of things   before i didn't have the time because all i had to do was point at corporate   y'all the problem okay it wasn't them it's me girly doing construction in the hallway ciao   that's the end of that emotional conversation i don't even know if i can keep that in there   y'all may just see me go from no makeup to makeup   anyways i'm gonna go ahead and put on some mascara i'm gonna use the um smashbox super fan fanned out   mascara in the color black i just read that whole thing because i was thinking like oh   my god anyways i think the face turned out really good and it looks like skin i'm so happy about it   so y'all let me know what are they doing in hallway y'all let me know what you think down below oh my god all in all i can say it is success i'm the happiest i've ever been believe   it or not i'm just always open to being critical of myself so i don't want y'all to think i'm not   happy because i'm the happiest i've ever been but i realize what things i need to work on that's all   i'm saying but i am ecstatic i am in love with what i do i'm in love with my office there are   days where i'm not editing where i'm thinking like i want to edit i want to film like i'd be thinking   about it there's like an impulse to do it even if i'm like super exhausted i just love doing this   and i i wouldn't go back to corporate if you pay me well they do pay you but you know what   i'm saying you couldn't pay me enough to go back girl i'm not going back to this   club i'm just so happy i made that choice best choice i ever made um hopefully i handle that responsibly girl oh i'm trying to do my lips what do i

all of the lessons that I learned about my business throughout this year,   which I talk about in episode 92, I am better prepared to exceed what I made this last year', 'One of these lessons that I learned was that my slow seasons can be very slow   and this last year I only generated about $1000 a month during these slow seasons', 'A lot of this has to do with how seasonal my designs are', 'So this next year I have to see if I can make more in my slow seasons,   and one of the strategies that I have in place to help me with this   is sourcing products for my Amazon store that are not as seasonal and that sell year round', 'One of the products that I sell year round are my blank T-shirts   that my customers use to make their projects with my designs', 'This next year I’m gonna be focused on finding more profitable products   to sell on Amazon that can help increase my revenue', 'But there’s a good chance that my slow months might still not generate up to $17,000,   which is why I also have to put energy into doing even better during my peak months', 'It will actually be much easier for me to make even more than $17,000 in a month during   a busy season than it will be for me to try to get my slow seasons to generate $17,000', 'So if I make enough during my busy seasons, which are seven months out of the year,   I can use my profits to help me during my slower months', 'So if I need to make $17,000 a month, that’s $204,000 a year in revenue', 'Knowing that that’s how much I need to make in the whole year, if I’m only able to exceed what   I made last year during my slow seasons by 3X, let’s say I make $3000 during my slow months,   that’s $15,000 total that I make during the five months that sales are slow', 'That means I’ll have to make $189,000 during my seven busy months, which is   $27,000 for each of those peak months where I get a huge volume of orders', 'These numbers might seem monumental until you have a data point to work off of,   so I have my numbers from last year which is my starting point', 'One of my goals for next year will be to increase my revenue during my slow months by 2 to 3X,   and I’ll do this in two ways, by being even more prepared for minor holidays where people still buy   designs, although not in such large volume as the major holidays, and by sourcing more products for   my Amazon store that are less seasonal, and that I can sell consistently throughout my slow months,   and I’ve been sourcing and testing at least one new product for Amazon each month', 'I wasn’t that well prepared for those minor holidays this past year,   which is OK, I wrote them down, and I made a calendar for next year so that   I don’t miss them and so that I can get designs out in time', 'And hopefully these strategies help me see more revenue during the slow seasons,   I’ll definitely let you know how that goes next year', 'My second goal for next year is to increase my revenue during my busy months by 3X', 'Now that I already know my best sellers during every single major holiday,   I can put those best-selling designs back out there and know that they’ll sell well', 'The advantage I have now that I believe can help me 3X my revenue is that I have   an email list in the thousands that I can promote to during these high-volume months', 'My revenue for last year was mainly just from the marketplaces alone, mainly new customers', 'But this next year, I have a lot of returning customers that I have spent the last year   building a relationship with, and now they are far more likely to purchase again from me', 'In addition, I am much more experienced at using Amazon as a selling platform,   and I have a few products on there that sell very consistently,   and as I get more reviews on my products, they’ll sell at an even higher volume', 'I also know to put out my seasonal designs much earlier than I did last year, so I expect to   get lots of early sales from customers who buy their designs 1 to 2 months before that holiday', 'For example, last year I made a third of my revenue for Valentine’s Day in January,   and a third of my revenue for Halloween in September,   a whole month and a half to two months before the holiday even dropped', 'I’m really excited to see how I do next year now   that I have all of this data and information to work with', 'And once I do hit those numbers and I see consistency throughout the year,   I’ll know I’ll be ready to quit', 'It’s not just about matching the salary at your job,   you have to know how much your expenses are and your expenses are going to change if you   have health insurance through your job and have a 401(k) that your job matches', 'You also have to know realistically what your business can bring in not just in revenue,   but in profit after you’ve paid all of your fees and expenses', 'And you have to know how your revenue throughout the year will fluctuate   based on seasonality and demand during certain periods of the year', 'So there you have it friend, I really hope you enjoyed this episode, what did you think?

pick Jackson Ashley today Iwant to talk to you about taking leaps of faith in our life and specificallytwo things around them number one is how do we know when we're being called tospiritually take a leap of faith and number two is how do we go around doingit so for myself at around two o'clock this afternoon I walked into my boss'soffice with a lot of confidence and also a little bit of anxiety and I gave myresignation so to the average person that might sound pretty normal so youquit your job to me it goes a little bit deeper than that this is one of threepositions that I currently hold but it is the only one that is funding mybusiness the one that has the most stability and the one that has thehighest connections in my field so now you might be thinking why on earth wouldyou give all that out and for me it comes down to the fact that Ispiritually felt like to close that door and not shop there in my life and moveon to something else what that something is you have to figure it out but I felt- I'm to take this stuff and so I did and so how do you know when you'respiritually being caught him take one of these leaps for me it comes down towhere my decision is being based so I find that decisions are either driven bymy flesh or driven by my spirit decisions that are driven by my fleshare ones I often make when my emotions are at one or two one of the otherextremes one of the other one of two extremes and am either very excited andmake an emotional decision out of excitement or make a decision I'mfeeling a little bit more down or depressed and these decisions are onesthat I often have not put much thought into especially not spiritually so Ihaven't been praying about them I haven't been seeking God's guidance inthat decision it's just kind of spur the moment I feel like doing this I'm gonnado it that's my flesh spiritually when I feelcalled to make a spiritual decision I oftentimes have spent some time eitherin prayer or journaling but just trying to seek where God is trying to lead itlead on the steps that are going to follow but it's also one that this mighthave a men and despite having a bit of anxietyor hesitation or not being excited about the decision itselfI still have peace in my spirit I'm not questioning whether or not it is a gooddecision based on purely the outcome I am questioning the decision based onwhat my spirit is sensing and often time no matter what I feel or what theoutcome might be my spirit is usually at peace with making that call so that'show I differentiate where my decisions are coming from how do you make thedecision how do you take that leap honestly band-aid do it just do it justtake the leap don't overthink the outcome I am someone who really overanalyzes and really likes to rationalize a lot of my decisions and I have foundthat the more you do that the more anxiety you're gonna give yourself themore fear you're gonna surround yourself by so if you bought it to the pointwhere you're like you know what I know God is telling me to take this next stepinto you know the next chapter the next season that might mean opening a doormight mean closing a door and just do it if you already know is coming from Godyou have to just take that jump you have to look fierce straight in the eyes andsay you know what you have no control I am doing this if not we can often find alot of the time we're not just kind of standing on the shore of our dreams weend up facing fear questioning although you know what will people think of mewhat will happen to a B and C what will the outcome be what if I fail and allthese questions really hold us back from pursuing the fullness of our purpose andour calling and so band-aid just do it is it going to hurt maybe quite honestlyyou'll probably cry about it a little later I know that making this calmalthough it might seem calm right now there was a lot of fear around it therewas a lot of them questioning what will people think what will happen to mybusiness and is it really you know the spirit that's leading me and making thisbut at the end of the day once I have deciphered that I really do feel God iscalling me to take this leap there's nothing left for me to do but decide amI going going to stand on the shores and stay with myfears or am I going to trust a guy that hasn't failed me and take that leap andjust go forth into what he's calling me to do and so just what I encouraging inthat if you've currently and or if you are currently kind of humming and hawingdeciding whether or not you want to take that leap and you have that unag normalgut feeling that you know this is something you have to do do it we havenothing but our pride to lose well maybe we have a little bit more than our prideto lose but in the bigger picture of knowing that God doesn't fail us reallywe don't have much more than our pride if you lose in taking that step so Ijust want to encourage you if you are about to make a decision or if youalready made the decision and now you have to act upon it be encouraged andknowing that God isn't going to leave you stranded he's not going to like inthe Bible with Jesus and Peter he's not gonna say hey come walk on water and letyou sink the minute that you say yes to God and grab a hold of his hand andtaking those steps forward he is going to open the right doors he is going tobring the right connections he is going to bring the provision that you needwill it always look like what you expect no God is kind of funny that waysometimes but is he always going to give you exactly what you need for thatseason absolutely if it is him that you are putting your trust in yeah so that'swhat I wanted to talk about today taking leaps of faith if you're about to takeone or just took one like myself leave it on a comment below I would love tohave you in thoughts and in prayer during my quiet times and just encourageyou in the next season that you are walking into you in your life so comeback hopefully you'll come back

Yes sir Thank you This part of my life, this little part is called happiness but fast-forward to over a decade ofhitting all my sales goals putting my head down and staying loyal to one company and I wasn't any happier Although I was making the six figures and doing what I thought would make me happy I was living in a constant state of fear I feared losing my job, missing a mortgage payment, being a loser, and ultimately dying a lonely miserable death no matter how hard I pursued happiness I needed a break but first I had to confront my biggest fear Four years ago on October 1st 2014 I decided to sell my home My connection to my friends, my career, my tax deduction, and safety net against inflation I literally put my own sweat and all thedollars I saved eating the one dollar spicy chicken sandwich into this condo but you see this wasn't just a condo It represented the cornerstone of my American Dream A dream I wanted so bad that I chased after it like a madman eating value meals at McDonald's After seeing Ally that day, something inside Noah snapped Some called it a labor of love Others called it something else But in fact, Noah had gone a little mad But this madness is quintessentially the American Dream Buy a starter home, buy some tools, make it nice, and everything will work out Hello Hell, maybe even Rachel McAdamswill show up at my doorstep Maybe this was the case for our parent's generation but for me, it felt like the greatest lie ever created A lie designed to enslave me into an endless cycle of work, debt, and an insatiable appetite to consume more The American dream I had  truly was madness Now as much as I wanted to make a u-turn from this American lie I had a career that was just too good to give up but also I wasn't in a situation financially to retire I felt like I was just too old to start new but also too young to see out the rest of my days so trust me when I say quitting was thelast thing I wanted and I didn't even know how to explain it to my friends who would consider it an impulsive and irresponsible decision at my age but regardless of what my friends or family thought I knew I had to get out and it's been the happiest 4 years of my life I got to travel to all the places I onlydreamt about I discovered amazing countries and people Tried interesting foods and tasted delicious cuisines Visited crowded cities filled withpeople and activity and ancient ruins filled with history and culture of course I saw breathtaking natural sites and even sites that no longer exist but what made all of this even betterwas being able to experience it with my new girlfriend, travel buddy, and biggest supporter in all my endeavors Mayu I even eventually found a small condo to purchase so I never have to worry about another mortgage payment and pursued all the hobbies that I never had the time for including my passion for photographyand videography but best of all, I finally experienced freedom getting to choose the dream I want to live instead of being surrounded by a culture that isconstantly bombarded with media of only Hollywood's version of an ideal life so should you also live and travel in Asia?

little bit\", \"Because in my mind, whenI was pursuing the goal of becoming a millionaire bythe age of 30, which I did, I didn't care about anything else\", \"I literally didn't care about sleep, I

very specific type of person, and if you're not that kind of person, you need some comfort\", 'Also, if you have dependents on you', \"If you have very little responsibility, it shouldn't be so hard for you to replace your income anyway, so it's not gonna take so long\", \"But if you have people depending on you, you don't wanna just give up everything\", \"But also don't use thisas a crutch for yourself, have goals for yourselfto hit in your business, and try to stick as muchas possible to those goals, because then you know you're on track and you're not just stretching it out because you

played of Joe Rogan at thebeginning of this video wasn't the full picture, but I was just tryingto illustrate the point that a lot of the timepeople get caught up in these motivational videos, and then they quit theirjobs sooner than they should\", 'But what was really said at the beginning of the Joe Rogan clip is this', '- And I think if peoplehave a regular day job, if you could just find some, one thing that you do as a passion project and just keep building on it, just keep watering it,keep adding fertilizer, keep giving it attention,keep giving it focus, and you can escape, you can

witha slightly different story', 'I called mine wisdom and immortality, and this was a fund thathad about six months worth of expenses that would cover me off in case things went wrong', 'But the thing is, Inever touched this money', 'I just had it there, becauseI had never in my life previously experienced the weightlessness that I felt when I had this money', \"It's like, there isanother level of your mind that becomes free becauseyou're not in that much of an intense fight or flight mode\", \"I can't describe it, I canonly tell you to try it, have this buffer behind you, and see what it does to your mind\", \"It frees you, it's amazing\", 'And then, so this is my wisdomand immortality bank account, which a lot of peoplecall the emergency fund', 'And then on top of that, I started saving for an emergency fund in case things did go wrong', 'So this one, I never touched,it became invisible to me, it was just there to help me alleviate the heaviness of the financial world, and then I had a savingsbuffer on top of that', \"So when you're getting into business, if you still have a steady job try to build these funds up a little bit, three to six months in thewisdom and immortality, three to six months foryour emergency fund\", \"So that means when you'reworking on your business, maybe already full timebecause you got to the point where you could become full-time\", \"Even if something goes wrong and you don't getclients for a few months, you don't have the stress because you have this money behind you\", \"Otherwise you start freaking out, you lose your creative

harder at the start to pay off your debt withyour business, it just is, so you wanna do that whenyou have a steady income\", 'Think of this as a sprint in life', \"At this point in time, you're working on yourside hustle business, I don't like calling it sidehustle, part-time business\", \"You're working in your job,you're working weekends, you're working nights\", 'Think of it a like sixmonth, 12 month sprint of you just tryingeverything you possibly can to pay off that debt, as well as cutting back on entertainment, going out with friends,drinking on weekends', 'Just do it for yourself, a12 to 24 months sacrifice so you can be debt free,and start your journey of financial prosperity,is really well worth it', \"And also, when you can, cut up that damn credit card, all right?

sense because there's a community around it where like this is somethingyou go do with your friends\", \"It's a boost of serotonin\", 'Like everyone that likes Boba at least, they feel joy when they get it', 'So my first game was a very simple game where you catch ingredientsthat are falling from the top of the screen and you catch it in a cup and you have to like fulfill an order', 'I kind of got the idea a little bit from a game I used toplay when I was a kid, I was like a Lilo and Stitchsandwich stacking game', 'I used to play that game so much, like both Nia and I would spend hours playing that game together', 'So that same like fun feeling, \"I\\'m like, okay, let melet\\'s do that but with Boba.\" So that was my first game', \"It's probably the simplestout of all of them, but it like sparked the feeling in me where I'm like, okay I want to keep doing this\", 'When making the first game I honestly just tweeted about it and sent it to friends, posted it on my social media

away\", 'When you open the app back up hours later, or days later, you earn money', 'So I made a game like that it was called \"Boba Barista Idle\"', 'That game I had a lot more direction, I tried to replicate othergames in the same category and I was able to learn from it', 'I added analytics to it', 'I added reward ads to it', \"So now I'm getting into monetization\", \"Now I'm getting into making insights\", 'And what free to play actually was', 'So with the Idle Boba game, the one that I launchedin February of 2021, I learned a lot from that launch', 'I learned a lot about how to make insights off of the analytics', 'I learned that like one ofthe most important things is retention', 'I learned about like makingfeatures based on analytics', \"And I also learned that Iwasn't being strategic enough with who my audience was\", 'Owning a game studio or trying to like run agame studio is not easy', 'You have to wear a lot of hats, especially as the only engineer on it', 'I have to

getting to know my users', 'There\\'s this one game I playedcalled \"Animal Restaurant.\" And I played it for at leastthree months, every single day', \"There's an achievement in that game that's like how many as you've watched cause they also use reward ads\", 'And I got the achievement of1200 ads watched for that game', \"And so I'm like, well,this is the same audience that this game is going

something completely scandalous   it just came to a point where it wasn't what i wanted to do anymore   but now i'm terrified this probably sounds quite irresponsible   not knowing what's next is a scary thing we're taught that we should go to school and get a job   but the thing is once we get there we're likely to spend approximately 45 years of our life working   and what's really scary is that a large part of the world's population   spend this valuable time trapped in jobs that they don't really care about or enjoy   some of us are lucky enough to get a lot of satisfaction from the jobs that we currently do   and if you found that elusive work-life balance you're one of a lucky few   however if you're not currently finding yourself waking up excited on a monday morning pumped for   the week ahead you might want to consider if what you're currently doing for work is really what   you wanted as a little background i started my journey of becoming an architect way back in 2009   it took a long eight years of studying and work experience to finally be able to call myself this   so it may come as a surprise that i've decided to leave something that i once called my dream job   to make things clear i still love architecture back in the day as a student i was filled with   ambition to perhaps one day go out on my own and become the next big thing   however after qualifying and finally accomplishing this goal i started to   realize that the likelihood of becoming fulfilled in this field whilst employed was really rather   slim and i started to ask myself questions like what gave me my sense of purpose to begin with   it quickly dawned on me that there was a large portion of my job that i didn't enjoy   i love design but i started to notice that i was only really doing things to help very privileged   people augment or multiply their assets which didn't really make me feel that good or fulfill   any sense of my life's purpose what i really wanted to be doing with my work was expressing   my creativity in a way that might help the people who need it the most while being employed i soon   realized that there was always a ceiling above me limiting my progression and my responsibility   a lot of times there was always someone above me calling the shots which often meant that there was   nothing that i could do to make projects run more effectively or more efficiently perhaps with my   comparatively small amount of experience it would be naive of me to think that i could do a better   job than those above me but really the lack of control began making me feel unsettled and i was   itching to get more control and fulfillment back in my life rather than just sacrificing my time   for money and things that i didn't really care about although i was comfortable in my job i began   to realize that a huge part of why i was keeping this job was because of a sense of security   we need to work in order to provide ourselves with shelter clothing and food but when you   really think about it job stability is really just a myth you never know what's around the corner   so a company might go bankrupt some new technology might take over your job or your own circumstances   might change very quickly so the sense of security that employment gives you may not   be as profitable as it seems when there's such a trade-off for what you really want to be doing so although being an employee in a successful architecture firm wasn't the answer to what   i wanted to be doing i still didn't feel secure enough to do anything else   and i really needed the money so i did the only thing that seemed rational at the time   and began to save i didn't really know why i was saving as initially all i knew was that it made   me feel more secure in case something did go wrong but i ended up coming to the conclusion   that the logical thing to do with that money was to invest it in an apartment in order to   mitigate the cost of rent and hope that one day the mortgage would be paid off in full   around the same time my mum began to express her desire to renovate her house in a way that would   allow my potential future family to live at home while she gets older so as a side hustle i poured   everything into redesigning the house so that it would fit a growing family i worked late almost   every single day we demolished walls built a new bathroom a new driveway and extended the house   all this additional work wasn't always pleasant at times but it was all towards this idea of   eventually being able to do what i really wanted with my life this new arrangement would also give   me the ability to rent out my apartment and for the first time i realized that if things worked   out i may be able to get some of my life back to give me more time to do what i've really wanted to   this is where things start to get a little crazy while all of this was going on the best possible   thing ended up happening i ended up meeting and eventually marrying my amazing wife nisha   and we decided to redesign the apartment in a way that we could both live in it together comfortably   and came up with the layout that many of you are familiar with from my minimalist micro apartment   video after doing this i thought to myself hm this layout could actually help some people   as surely there are a bunch of people living in tiny spaces with the same challenges as us   so seeing as one of my passions other than architecture is photography i decided to make a   quick video and throw it up on youtube to see how it might do and somehow out of nowhere this video   managed to get a mind-boggling 1 million views after making several more videos just for fun   this has now brought me to a point where this is a viable career option which still blows my mind   as i still feel like who would want to listen to me ramble in front of a camera week after week   and i feel like this is something that i shouldn't be able to do full-time just because i enjoy it so   much this experience has caused me to realize that employment and society teaches us that you   can never really do what you love because it's just not financially realistic instead society   tells us we should be cogs trapped in a world system that doesn't care for us one bit because of   that financial incentive the thing is money will never buy you happiness or give you purpose but we   still chase it there's literally somebody interested in everything and anything that   you can be interested in you will find others who also are so really we have a unique opportunity   to do whatever gives us our life purpose it just means we need to be willing to work hard enough   and take the risk if it means enough to us i would never have known this unless i had first   asked myself the question of what i really wanted to do and just gone for it the thing is the first   step is often the most scary there is so much about the unknown that cripples us with fear   however there's something that i remember hearing a while back which is life shrinks and expands in   direct proportion to your willingness to assume risk now looking back at my twenties i've realized   that every time i followed the inner sense of life and peace within me and taken the risk towards the   direction that matters to me the most it's always proven to be the best thing that i could have done   sure i've made mistakes along the way and will probably continue to do so but by following what   really matters to us it becomes the driving force towards the future that we really want   all of our individual situations are different and we can never know how long finding fulfillment   might take as life is just unpredictable that way but it seems illogical to me to complain about our   circumstance and put no effort in to make a change there is something about following our sense of   purpose where our continuously small inputs and improvements eventually meet opportunities which   is the fabrication of our own quote quote luck in being able to do what we care about the most   considering that we're likely to spend 45 years of our life working it's probably worth doing   everything within our power to make sure that we're doing something that we truly care about   looking back becoming an architect is one of the things that i'm most proud of and although i'm now   choosing to focus more of my time on youtube photo and video it is this that has given me the biggest   sense of peace and is the one thing that i'm doing which is pushing me towards what i really   want from my life and giving me the time for my life's purpose i guess i'm sharing this story   in the hope that it will help one of you guys who might be going through a similar situation   as i know stories like this on youtube really helped me on the path to where i am now we're all   wired differently and what makes you happy might not be what makes someone else happy and that's   completely fine but by really looking ourselves in the mirror and asking what matters to me the most   whether that's a career our family or our faith we can begin to identify the things that hold us   down and start to reduce their impact on our lives sometimes figuring out what truly makes us happy   can take a little searching and that's why i'm always happy to have my videos sponsored by online   resources such as skillshare although i'm an architect i began finding that i had a passion for   film and photography by learning things online and now it's become a huge part of my daily life when   stumbling upon this journey of becoming an online content creator i wish that i had some guidance   before getting started so if you're planning to or have already started sharing your voice online i'd   highly recommend checking out a brand new course on skillshare by the one and only nathaniel drew   in this course he gives incredible advice towards starting out including addressing insecurities and   developing your core theme i particularly found this helpful as even though some may consider me a   now successful youtuber i still very much struggle with these things on a daily basis what's cool   about skillshare is that it's an online learning community that offers classes on an enormous array   of topics like design business cooking baking or even things like flower arrangement to find out   more the first 1000 people to click the link in the description will get a two month free trial   of premium membership where you can

wanted to help people who need it the most and   creating content online has been a great way for me to share my story and express my creativity and   hopefully it's bringing you guys a lot of value i can truly say that i've never been any happier   than i am right now and i hope that somehow my story might be able to help in some way or other   if you're currently finding yourself moving jobs

take up another corporate job hold the vision   trust the process what's up everyone welcome back to my channel the best place for new   coaches content creators and entrepreneurs in today's video i wanted to really reflect back   on the last two years since quitting my corporate job i quit my corporate job   may of 2018 and i started this youtube channel july of 2018\", \"so it has been well over two years   since i quit cold turkey created this channel and now have a multi-million dollar business   and beyond that we're at a place where not only do i have this business but i'm also employing   other people to work with me in this business so my transformation since leaving my corporate   job has been insane like even looking back i would not have even fathomed that i would get   this far just within those two years and so this video is really here to share some perspective   shifts that i've made in the last two years some life lessons that i've learned since quitting my   corporate job because i can assure you right now the way that i think today is so different than   how i was thinking two years ago when i was making these videos all about quitting the nine to five   and so if you're someone who is either debating on quitting the nine of five or maybe you just   quit the nine of five i wanna offer some wisdom i wanna offer some perspective changes i want   to offer some insight on things that you might also learn as you grow as you develop and as you   have and accumulate more life experiences after leaving the nine to five and it doesn't matter if   you've left the nine of five to start your own business it doesn't matter if you've left your   nine to five and you have no back-up plan and you're super lost like how i was two years ago   or if you're leaving your nine-to-five for another nine to five whatever big change that you're going   through right now i hope that this video can really kind of support you and make you feel   like you're more supported and also give you some perspective shifts that you might not see   right now but you might see maybe a month or a year later on so if you're interested in learning   about what i have to say and my experiences since quitting the nine of five then keep on watching   i was so afraid to start over i was so afraid to let go of all the years of work that i put in to   get to the place that i'm at i was so afraid of starting rock bottom that i was just fearful of   letting it go and it's so silly to think about it now because i already knew the environment that i   was in wasn't serving me i already knew that i didn't like doing what i was doing but because   i was so fixated on the past and i was so fixated on all the accumulation of work energy resources   that i put in to get to the position that i was in to get to the company that i was in that i   just couldn't see how i could possibly let it go and now that i'm on the other side of it   i'm so glad i let it go and what i've learned too is quitting is not a bad thing and i think that i   was conditioned so long to think that quitting was shameful quitting is something that says   something about you that says that you couldn't handle it that you couldn't take it that you   weren't strong enough but quitting takes a lot of courage it takes a lot of courage to stand up for   what you believe in it takes a lot of courage to demand a better environment for yourself it   takes a lot of courage to start over and it takes a lot of courage to say no when you are quitting   something it doesn't have to mean that you're a failure instead whenever i hear my friends and   hear that they've quit their jobs or you guys who message me and tell me that you've quit your job i   am always seeing it in the lens of congratulations congratulations for choosing a different future   congratulations on putting a bet on yourself congratulations on actually changing your   environment because at the end of the day what you aren't changing you are choosing if you decide   hey you know what i'm just going to stay at this job that i hate but yet you complain about that   job every single day you have to ultimately take responsibility for that choice that you've made   because if you're not quitting and if you're not choosing to let it go and do something else then   you're essentially choosing the opposite which is staying in that situation and that's not on anyone   else it's not on your boss it's not on your mom your parents your family your friends it's on you   when you say no to something you're actually saying yes to other things you might not be able   to see what you're saying yes to yet especially if you're like me and you're quitting cold turkey but   you might not be able to see you know what you're making more space for but just understand that you   are making more space because if you're choosing to stay in a situation that's already putting you   at capacity in terms of your tolerance in terms of your energy in terms of your mental space   nothing else is going to be able to come through in your life you're not going to be able to   receive anything else that perspective has really you know helped me in having better boundaries too   even today in my business even today i choose to say no to a lot of things because the act   of quitting my job two years ago taught me that valuable lesson that when i say no to something   i'm saying yes to something else even if that something else happens two years later or a year   later or five years later you know i'm making space and if i already know i don't want to do   something if i already know that whatever is being presented to me doesn't put me in expansion and   it doesn't make me excited and it doesn't you know make me want to spring out of bed and say heck yes   then it's a no on top of that understand that you are capable of doing new things and a   good question that i like to ask people because oftentimes especially with entrepreneurs because   i know a lot of you guys who watch my channel are interested in starting a business you know   oftentimes you can't distinguish the difference between something that's new versus something that   you actually aren't good at or something that you really don't like doing oftentimes you have to ask   yourself is something hard because it's new or is something hard because you're actually incompetent   or because you actually don't like doing the task and i think that this is also something that   i've learned over time especially with starting a business and even maintaining a business at every   stage of growth whether you are starting at zero in your business or whether you have a million   dollar business or a 10 million dollar business at every stage you're gonna need to do new things   you're gonna need to learn new things with new things come with a lot of discomfort it comes   with a lot of self-doubt because these are things that you've never done before i remember i was so   hard on myself after quitting my nine-to-five and i was like why aren't i up and running yet how   come my business isn't successful yet how come my life isn't perfect yet i quit my job now what how   come it's not happening for me but you have to realize like quitting your job is a really big   deal and quitting your job is something you likely have never done before or maybe even starting a   business is something you've never done before or starting a new job in a different industry is   something that you've never done before or just taking a break quitting your job just to find   yourself is also something that you've never done before but as type a humans as overachievers which   i think a lot of you guys who watch my channel pretty much have the same profile as me i know   it's so easy again to make that mean something about us it's so easy to think that oh my gosh   this is hard therefore i'm not good enough this is hard therefore i must be stupid this is hard   therefore building a business or changing careers or doing whatever must not be for me and so one of   my favorite mantras in this year actually is i am capable of doing hard things and to me what   this means is for so long i would always avoid the hard things because i didn't think that i   was capable of doing them and a good example and it kind of leads back to the whole spiel that i   talked about about intelligence one of my weakest points is math i barely passed math in university   i think i passed with like 53 i passed by 3 and even throughout high school i got straight a's   great for me but it took a lot of tutors to make that happen it took a lot of office hours to even   get an a in grade 12 math because i wasn't great at it i wasn't good at it and even when i worked   in corporate you know it's filled with all these spreadsheets about how the company is doing and   the growth and all these things and i would spend so long on google trying to figure out excel and   how to you know calculate percentage growth and percentage difference and to this day i still   need to google percentage difference calculator to figure it out right and so because of these   instances that i had in my life i immediately associated myself as someone who isn't good with   numbers and that in some sense haunted me as i was building my business i was always avoiding looking   at the numbers and understanding my analytics and just understanding the financial side of things i   avoided looking at money avoided looking at all those things because i kept telling myself that   i wasn't good at it until something just snapped this year and i told myself you know what like i   am capable of doing hard things i'm gonna roll up my sleeves and i'm gonna learn this i'm gonna ask   questions i'm gonna go to my cpa and ask as many questions as i want i'm gonna go to my mentor   and be in this mastermind even though other people in this mastermind have years more experience   than i do i'm gonna raise my hand and say hey i don't know how to do this can you help me or hey   i have a question i know it might be a silly one but i need to understand these numbers and fast   forward today in my business my transformation and my relationship with numbers specifically for   you could be something different has completely changed in my business spreadsheet like a boss   i love reading my numbers every week i ask my team to share the numbers we are so data driven   now in my business and i freaking love it i love the fact that i can join meetings and understand   what we're talking about i love the fact that i'm able to interpret data on a spreadsheet   back then i hated it and i also associated that with my identity i said you know i'm just someone   who's not good with numbers and therefore don't touch numbers at all but now that i've overcome   that and that i've rolled up my sleeves to learn the numbers now my identity and my beliefs have   completely changed which shows to me that it's not that i never liked doing numbers it's just that i   never took the time to learn and i never took the time to learn because i kept telling myself and i   kept identifying myself as someone who wasn't good with numbers what i want to share with you two   years later since quitting the corporate job is when you quit something to do something new there   are gonna be new things that you've never done and because you've never done them it's gonna be   super painful super uncomfortable and there will be self-doubt but just understand that it's okay   to start over and that you are capable of learning new things and you're capable of doing hard things   and after you overcome that and after you learn the thing or you do the damn thing you're then   going to be able to truly assess whether it's something that you don't like doing at all or if   it's something that you just didn't know how to do but once you learn it you actually like it because   it's really important in life to just know the difference between something that truly puts you   in contraction something that you truly don't like doing don't want to do don't have a desire to do   and when you do it even if you're good at it you just hate it versus something that is just unknown   to you and therefore you have resistance around it starting a business doing something new is going   to be hard for everyone and until you actually get over that hump and get over that resistance   and you do the damn thing you're then going to be able to collect the data and assess whether this   is something that you truly as a human being to your core hate doing in which case especially if   you have a business now you know this is something you need to outsource or if it's something that   you're actually capable of doing that you could be good at doing but you're just avoiding it because   it's new and because it's hard and so that's one thing that i definitely learned in my last   two years since quitting the corporate job that i wish i knew sooner and i hope can also change   your perspective especially if you're at a place right now where things are uncomfortable you will   grow through it and that's another little thing that i've learned too is growth is not designed   to be easy every time i have a mental breakdown in business or i feel you know a type of way or i cry   in business or my mind is just filled with anxiety and scary thoughts and just fear a lot of times   it's because i'm doing something new a lot of times it's because i am doing something that i've   never done before and every time that i go through that my business income wise has always taken   huge leaps and what i want to say about this is the fact that the result of growth is fun and   dandy the result of growth is something that you put in your instagram bio that you brag to your   friends about that you know you really are proud of but the process of growth is very uncomfortable   you will cry and it's not fun it's not fun but it's not fun because you're doing something that   you've never done before and so i know that i'm saying the same thing pretty much over and over   again but i can't emphasize enough how important it is in life to just understand that and sit in   that discomfort of doing the unknown sit in the discomfort of doing something big and huge that   you've never done before and sit in the discomfort that you don't know everything and that's okay   because there is time to learn it but if you have so much resistance in the beginning to even take   the first step to learn then you are deciding and you are choosing to stay in the same place forever   and so that's one thing that you definitely want to keep in mind of as you embark in a new   chapter of your life now the next lesson that i've learned since quitting my corporate job   is if there is something that you are afraid to say out loud there's something that you want to do   that you're embarrassed about to say out loud that you don't even want to admit out loud you should   wholeheartedly pursue it this is coming from a place where i have been wanting to start a   damn youtube channel since high school and that's like a long time ago like over 10 years ago over a   decade ago it was always something that i really couldn't say out loud because i was embarrassed   but every new year's every time i was goal-setting i'd always write it in my notebook and it's funny   because when i actually quit my corporate job nobody really knew what the heck i was doing and   even though i say i had no idea what i was doing and i quit cold turkey and stuff deep down inside   i knew i wanted to start a youtube channel from some sort but i didn't want to tell people that   i'm not saying that you need to shout it to the rooftops of what you want to do in life and share   it with everyone and post tweet about it or do a facebook update about it i think that it's   okay to keep it to yourself but if you're watching this video and you are on the cusp of potentially   making a change in your life and potentially taking a leap of faith i just want to at least put   this in this video and give you the permission to do the thing that you're afraid of saying out loud   do the thing that you have been thinking about non-stop for years do the thing that you journal   about all the time when you are in the comfort of your own privacy you know do it because life is   too short not to do it and also there's a reason why year over year you're thinking of doing the   thing that you want to do there's a reason why it's never left your mind and oftentimes   when you do it you might actually realize that you don't really like it and it's not for you in which   case now you can pivot and now you have even more time to figure out what you want to do in life or   the thing that you're afraid of saying out loud that you truly want to do it could be the thing   that changes your life it could be the thing that is so powerful the moment that you do it   that ends up really changing your life 180 just like how mine did it's almost as if like the thing   that you're thinking of doing is just so powerful and so big and you know that it's something that   would probably make you super happy and that would put you in expansion and that would really unleash   all of your strengths sometimes i wonder if it's so powerful and that's why we're so afraid of   saying it out loud because a little piece of us thinks that what if it would actually work what if   i'm actually successful at it what if it actually ends up changing my life and sometimes it's a very   scary thought to think about and i know that for a lot of us we journal about success we talk about   all the things that we want to achieve but those big things that we want to achieve often scare us   thing that you're thinking of doing is just such a big concept that you're afraid to say out loud and   that's okay but i just want to give you permission to actually do it because you have no idea what   doors can open if you do it and even if you do it and it fails or even if you do it and you realize   you don't like it at least you checked it off your list of things to do and now you can move   on to other things or in the process of doing that thing you might potentially or even accidentally   open doors to something greater now another lesson that i've learned since quitting my corporate job   two years ago is you will have silent supporters and just because you don't visibly see people   supporting you doesn't mean that you should give up i know especially if you are someone who is   thinking of quitting your job to start a business or maybe you've already done that and you're in   the beginning stages of starting your business it can feel like nobody is supporting you especially   if you are doing something similar to me and you're putting yourself out there on social media   you're not getting the views you're not getting the likes you're not getting the comments you   aren't getting that public recognition that you expect to have just know that there are people who   are rooting for you behind the scenes and people who don't publicly comment on things but are   watching your every move and this is coming from a place of two years later now that i have built   what i've built i actually get a lot of referrals from people who i used to be friends with or   people i used to go to work with or i've also had people from my friend's circle or my corporate   circle by my program the boss graham academy which is insane i actually have an old manager of mine   who enrolled in the program and i have a few other people that i have crossed paths with in my life   that have also enrolled in this program too and it's incredible to see and i'm just so glad that   in the beginning i continued to create content and i continued to trek on even though majority   of the people that i was doing content for was likely my friends and family and even if they   didn't publicly comment on my stuff the fact that they know what i was working on helped me in the   long run and what i've learned too is that even though your friends and family might not be your   ideal client or your ideal you know customer or whatever or your ideal subscriber ideal follower   the fact that they're even aware of what you're doing can truly help you with referrals can truly   help you get closer to people who are going to be interested in your content so another example is i   would not stop sharing my stuff on my personal instagram and actually the instagram that i have   today is the same instagram that i have had since college you know i would not stop sharing my stuff   i would not stop posting stories and i would not stop sharing myself to my personal facebook i was   sharing everything left right front and center and it's so interesting because often times i would   have people who follow me and they would say hey i followed you because my friend recommended your   profile i'm actually really hating my corporate job too can you tell me more about what you offer   and the person that would refer them would be my coworkers or my friends who them themselves have   no interest in what i'm working on but the fact that they know what i'm working on if they're   in contact with their own networks and their own friends and they're talking about certain subjects   that i share on my channel then they're gonna be like hey actually i have a friend vanessa who does   stuff like that let me send you her youtube channel and it's so interesting because in   the beginning i thought that my friends and my family don't support me and blah blah blah but   even if they don't visibly support you and they don't watch all your videos the fact that they   are aware of what you're working on again can help you so much in getting connected to other people   in their network it's all about referrals and i think that it's such a shame that a lot of newer   entrepreneurs they'll start secret instagram accounts or secret youtube channels and never   share that to their friends and family because they're embarrassed but what you have to realize   is you're actually closing yourself off of getting more views of getting more subscribers of getting   you more connected to people who would actually benefit from whatever project or whatever business   or whatever path that you're on right now don't shy away from sharing things even if it feels like   nobody is supporting your business or nobody's supporting your new career change right from the   get-go but anyways guys this video is definitely really long i hope that it was valuable i hope   i was able to share some perspective and some insights and i really hope that you in some sense   feel supported feel more grounded or just feel a little bit lighter since watching this video as   always i post a lot of videos on entrepreneurship marketing social media all the likes of that   so definitely check out these two videos that i have right here if you like this video share it   on your stories make sure you don't forget to tag me as always guys i appreciate you i hope   you guys have a great day a great week and a great life and i will see you in the next video bye guys \"], 'senti_emotions': [{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.75}, {'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear':

Is that actually good   advice? Should you just follow your dreams? Should you just quit your job and jump into the unknown?   Or should you just stay where you are right now? After all, it's pretty comfortable right? Well, in 2018, I decided to find out for myself because my dream was to   become a travel photographer and so I quit my job, sold my car, and canceled the lease   on our apartment\", 'United States', \"So,   what happened? I mean, does quitting your job and following your dream and passion actually   work? Does it change anything at all? Wow, that went from an exciting and uplifting intro to   a depressing one real fast, right? But don't worry because this right here me staring into   the distance that's just me acting so don't worry I am happy even though I didn't become a travel   photographer yeah it didn't happen now if you're watching this video then you probably also have   the feeling that you don't belong or you're stuck in a job that you don't like and you're dreaming   of doing something different so should you just quit then and chase that dream well maybe and   maybe not because let me just tell you what happened ever since I quit my job and started   traveling and remember guys I did this when I was 35 you know with back pains, rusty knees and you   know, according to some people you should have already figured out your life at the age of 30\", \"  I can tell you already those people are wrong I'm 39 now and I still haven't figured out everything   yet I don't know what I'm doing most of the time so you know if you're in your 20s don't   worry anyway if you have questions that don't get answered in this video just drop them in the   comments okay let's go so I studied photography and I graduated in 2009\", \"before that I actually   graduated in computer technology but that doesn't matter right now I just want to brag a little bit   um anyway so yeah and then I ended up in a job as a graphic designer slash photographer in a   Pet Products company and back then that was the perfect job I learned a lot but of course taking   photos of dog toys and designing packagings for cat snacks that wasn't really what I wanted to do   I wanted to be a Travel Photographer a documentary photographer like the great Steve McCurry that's   what I wanted to be so I decided to work towards that goal in my free time I traveled whenever I   could a few weeks a year year I worked on projects and I found out that I was actually good at it my   work got published I won awards so great right well no because the thing was it didn't really   go anywhere despite all the Publications and awards and then all of a sudden I realized   that I was already working at that company for eight nine years I mean what the hell happened   where did time go eight years and the older you get the more likely it is that you'll experience   something similar all of a sudden you're 35 45 55 and boom what the hell happened where did all   that time go and that's when something clicked in my head something like a switch got switched   and yeah that's when I decided maybe I should just quit my job and start traveling full time   that's the solution well in my head that was the solution of course I didn't know if it was   actually the solution but anyway I asked Joanna do you want to go traveling for at least a year   she said yes and a few weeks later I quit my job then I sold my car and we canceled our apartment   now just so you know Joanna didn't have a job at the time so I didn't force her to also quit   her job just so you know now a lot of people have told me that they find doing something like that   quitting your job and just go traveling for two years they find it scary and abnormal and it kind   of is because very few people do it but it's funny let me show you something so quitting my job was   actually a turning point for me but until then I was living before that turning point and from that   before perspective the Turning Point looked scary because for the turning point to have happen I had   to make a decision to change something in my life but once I was past the Turning Point looking back   I realized it wasn't so scary at all and so that's the problem if more people would know how changing   something in your life makes you feel after you've changed it more people would do it and it doesn't   have to be quitting your job it doesn't have to be so drastic it could be something smaller like   enrolling in a class to learn a new skill or just switching jobs but people are afraid of change so   they only see turning points from that scary before perspective which of course keeps them   from changing something in their life so what you have to do is try to look past that decision past   the turning point and just do it do it just do it okay yeah thank you Shia uh I hope it   all makes sense I kind of feel like one of those life coaching gurus and I'm not a life coaching   Guru this is just my experience of Life anyway of course I still had some doubts it still was   a jump into the unknown but what I did know was that it would be a once in a lifetime experience   for sure I told Joanna not to worry about anything I would plan everything we would spend my savings   because I made the decision to quit my job I was the one who had to make it work I think it   took us four or five months to plan everything sell everything cancel everything get the right   papers and documents and then the day was there we set off on our trip around the world first country   India and that was it we were actually traveling now it was really happening I was taking photos   every day I tried to come up with ideas for projects but of course no money was coming in   I was relying on almost 10 years of savings but I didn't want to spend everything I was willing   to rely on them for maybe six months you know give me some time to figure out how to make money   while traveling and before we left I also had prepared my website some digital products things   like that I also started writing a blog when we left it's still online by the way so there was   some kind of plan but no money coming in yet and in the back of my mind was still the thought of   yeah like when I had a nine to five job I was also trying to make money with my documentary   photography and my travel photography but it didn't work it didn't go anywhere so why would   it be any different now that I was traveling well the difference now was that something had changed   in my life remember the turning point and that change disrupted my routine it pulled me out of my   safe bubble it it broke the safe bubble and what that did was it changed Something In Here Also   and that had never happened before all of a sudden I was trying out different ideas I was trying to   find a way to make money while traveling and I was actually executing those ideas most of them   didn't work but that was fine because I felt like everything was moving everything kept changing I   felt progress slowly but surely and then by the end of year one I actually found a way to make   money while traveling something worked I started writing articles for websites and magazines about   traveling and about photography and cameras I also sold some digital products now it wasn't   my dream job but you know what I actually liked it because it motivated me I was actually making   money while traveling now now do keep in mind that I had those savings 10 years worth of savings and   it was a significant amount of money and it was also possible for us to leave everything behind   just like that so I realized that I found myself in a luxury position not everyone can do that and   if you try to do something like that without savings then I mean the pressure to make money   it would probably feel paralyzing right so I'm all for taking risk but calculated risks have a   basic plan but anyway what also happened very important slowly I started to find out that I   didn't actually wanted to be a Travel Photographer per se you know do assignments for magazines and   things like that because before that that was the dream but now all of a sudden my dream was not my   dream anymore what I realized was that what I actually wanted was just being self-employed   something that had to do with cameras of course and also something that I could do from anywhere   in the world so remote work that was what my dream actually was but I didn't realize it   before it just took time to find out that that was it so from then on that was the focus I expanded   my webshop I started doubling down on my YouTube channel I was also still writing articles so some   money came in not a lot but just enough to keep me going and keep me motivated and there was a   clear goal now not just a vague dream but it took time to find out it takes time to find out what   you want to do and sometimes also how to do it if you need to learn a new skill for example and   even if you think you have a dream it might not be your dream after all that's what I learned   from all this and it all started at the turning point I only started making progress when I made   a change in my life before that there was eight nine years of no progress okay so let's summarize   I quit my job to follow my dream of becoming a Travel Photographer and then I didn't become a   Travel Photographer here I am now I'm a YouTuber slash Video Creator I have my own little business   here I make videos for clients for companies I make YouTube videos it's working and I love it   so should you just quit your job and follow your dreams then just go for it just do it just do it   well if you can if you don't have three kids to feed mortgage to pay a lot of bills to pay if you   can't just leave everything behind and go travel like we did do it I highly recommended you won't   regret it but we have to be realistic here blindly quitting your job and chasing a dream is not a   solution nor an option for most people but that doesn't mean that you should just stay miserable   then of course not I think that a lot of people who feel stuck in a job that they don't like what   they need is change it was that change in my life that caused the disruption of my routine   and that kick-started the progress and making a change doesn't mean quit your job and follow   your dream it doesn't have to be so drastic but it has to be significant enough to disrupt your   routine so that you get pulled out of your safe bubble so that something in here can change that's   important as long as something in here doesn't change nothing will happen so try switching jobs   or try to find a halftime job so that you can spend more time doing whatever it is you think   you want to do and if that's not possible do something smaller enroll in that web design   course or pottery class I don't know whatever but you have to initiate change yourself do it I feel   like one of those gurus again but yeah that's what I think and even if it's a small ripple at first   the change that you make it will get bigger and change leads to more change and to better things   eventually and it'll be a long winding path with mistakes along the way but that's fine just don't   wait until next week because next week all of a sudden you'll be 80 or dead foreign [Music] \"], 'senti_emotions':

this was   the quote that recently changed mine it's a great quote that challenges us to go against our fears   and take risks to broaden our worldview it's not the first time i've heard it but this time   it really spoke to me since i've been stuck in a transitional phase in my career for some time some of you guys know that for the past four years i've been working for a non-profit agency   where i taught about homeownership and financial literacy to the affordable housing recipients   through the job i had incredible opportunities to teach my course in women's shelters homeless   shelters and to high school students who are preparing to go out into the world like any job most days were spent tediously filing away papers and making routine phone calls but   then there were days when i was able to witness my clients receive their keys to the first home   and these moments outshined all the difficult ones i played a small role for a big mission and through the job i learned what it   meant to think bigger than myself and it humbled me and always imaginable   so you're probably thinking why would she even think about leaving such an amazing job   i guess it was my time to see what's out there for me in the open seas i wanted to update you guys on what's been going on in my life and as from the title you probably   already know but i recently quit my job i wanted to talk about why i quit my job what i plan to   do moving forward and how important i think it is to honor the change that happens within us   so here's my story i graduated as a philosophy major and i had no idea what i wanted to do with   it but one thing i was always sure of was that i wanted to do something meaningful with my time   i was 26 very new to the island and somehow my boss decided to take a chance on me and that's   how i landed my first job at the non-profit agency like i mentioned so many times on my   channel but this really was my dream job basically my job was to teach people in the community and in   order to do that i really had to know a lot about real estate to create my curriculum i really had   to know the ins and outs of how a non-profit agency worked and i had to speak in front of a   lot of different people big crowds small crowds so i had to work on my public speaking skills   the salary was okay but it was steady and i could really see myself doing this for the long run   within our jobs i think we all have aspects that we like more than others then it's only natural   for us to start diving deeper into that one topic which then could spiral into something else   for me i became really interested in learning more about real estate so after work i would come   home and i would just research more about real estate investing and how i can do more diy home   projects by myself at one point i even thought about branching out and becoming a real estate   agent or maybe even taking my course and teaching it on youtube and i even thought about opening up   maybe my own interior design company i had so many different ideas but the point is i found   myself constantly thinking about new ways that i could transition from my current position i didn't   realize that at the time but it's clear to me now that i had clearly outgrown my job and naturally   i wanted to expand and branch out and learn something new and i think when we begin to feel   that it's only right for us to honor it and think of how we can pivot from our current trajectory a couple of years ago i came across a quote from jordan peterson that really   stuck with me order is not enough you can't just be stable and secure and unchanging because they   are still vital and important new things to be learned nonetheless chaos can be too much   thus you need to place one foot in what you have mastered and understood and the other and what you   are currently exploring and mastering quitting my job didn't happen overnight it was actually   premeditated for many years i think the first thing i did was write a proposal to my boss   and i asked her if i could teach remotely from home and to my surprise she said yes that really   freed up my time i was able to help my husband fix up this house then i also had time to start   this youtube channel i remember during that time we really had to reevaluate our budget   because our income was reduced and also whatever paycheck that we had most of it was going towards   construction materials but i think in the long run it was so worth it it was really a   small price to pay because what i was getting in exchange was some more time for me to think about   what i wanted to do moving forward while starting up these little projects on the side so i put in my two weeks notice about a month ago and it feels like i'm closing a huge chapter   in my life and actually my husband is also going through a huge transition in his life   and he's taking some time to think about how he wants to move forward for now we're okay we have   some money in our savings we have our investments and i also have this youtube channel which i'm   really grateful to all of you and i think why this youtube channel is so much fun for me   is because it's completely different than anything i've ever done i didn't really know much about   cameras or editing it was a steep learning curve and i think i really like those challenges but of   course i think about where is this going is this going to be forever and probably the answer is no   you know i'm always going to be looking for new challenges and my hobbies interests and my values   and priorities change all the time so i don't think i'm the type of person who will stick to one   thing forever and i think that's okay sometimes i even dream about opening up a little cafe   or working at a cafe or even starting a non-profit myself or really buying that mango orchard and   live off the land in the meantime i'm just gonna enjoy the ride and put my hundred percent effort   into whatever i'm doing at the time the biggest change since adopting a more minimalist lifestyle   isn't the fact that i have less things in my home and i have less pieces of clothes in my closet but   it's more the fact that i'm actively thinking more about how i can live more intentionally   i find myself asking a lot am i getting any value out of this am i still getting fulfilled   by what i'm doing and i think these questions are really vital because we change constantly i just want to say if you're not happy with your current situation   maybe you feel like you've outgrown your work maybe your hometown or even your relationships   i hope that you can find the courage and the willpower to put yourself in a position where you   can transition and i know it was so much easier for me and my husband because we have dual incomes   and also no kids so it does make it so much easier but i do believe that it has to start somewhere   and i think it starts with the right intentions it is never too late no matter what your age is   no matter how much you've invested in something   and no matter how far you've come you can always start over and i think that is truly the beauty   of life in the next few months i have so many new updates for you guys i'm really excited to   share and if you want to follow me more real time then you can go follow my instagram at malama life   let me know in the comments if you guys have been going through a transition yourself thank you guys   again so much for watching until next tuesday take care guys and i'll talk to you soon bye you \"], 'senti_emotions': [{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.51}]}\n",

living the life i want today i'm sharing them with you   lesson one at the start of my career when i was doing a traineeship i got to work for a   company through that same traineeship that built the infrastructure for big telecom providers in   holland and this company was not located near a big city in Holland and why is this important?   well the people working there were also not from a big city they had a different kind of mentality   i would say they were a little bit more down to earth maybe their life was a little slower than   those living in a big city you know how they always say in a big city everything is so fast   the tempo is a little bit higher but these guys seem a little bit more calm chill down to earth   and these guys there were mostly guys working at this company were kind of you know tough guys and   i remember one guy in particular let's call him Bert Bert was one of those like he was a tough   guy he was messing around making fun of everyone but in a light-hearted way he was a good guy and   i remember talking to him and he explained how he actually got to work for that company when he was   18 finished high school he basically just walked into in the office said hey i'm looking for a job   do you need someone they offered him his first job being in the field doing some kind of construction   building the infrastructure and he worked his way up to some kind of project management role   our department was focused on just one client and one day the client decided to pull the plug   they were not satisfied with the quality of work we were delivering and they said they did not   want to work with us anymore so from one day to the other our manager had to tell everyone in   our department that it's done we're done people had to start looking for other jobs there was   basically going to be reorganisation in the company and the moment the manager said this   some of those guys some of those 30 40 people that were working there including Bert the tough   guy started breaking down in tears and started crying i can remember them hearing them cry asking   what am i going to do how am i going to pay my mortgage how am i going to feed my kids remember   he's been working there for 40 years already and he just lost his job this was a big turning point   in my life and it was also one of the lessons i wanted to share with you today that day i realized   that no matter how hard you work no matter how permanent you think your permanent job is   there's things you don't have control over and Bert and some other guys grown men cried that   day because they didn't have a plan b because they were only dependent on one source of income   being that job that they lost that day so that's why i learned your permanent job is not   so permanent that's where i decided i eventually want to be my own boss i want to work for myself   i want to build something myself and not be dependent on a manager or a ceo or whoever   lesson number two now before this sounds like something a typical entitled millennial would say   hear me out i can remember a nice summer day back in 2021 i was walking through a nice big park in   Amsterdam with a good friend of mine it was a really sunny Friday morning i was always free   on Fridays as i had that day reserved for youtube i worked four days in a week as a data analyst so   i had one day in the week where i could focus on shooting videos writing scripts but to be honest   we didn't do any shooting that day because we were just enjoying the sun the weather our nice   conversations and we randomly came across this it looked like a swimming pool but it was only   this deep basically a swimming pool for your feet in the middle of the park in the middle of this   forest so we took off our shoes and we just stood there talking enjoying the sun and i can remember   one of the conversations we had is how this good friend of mine had a colleague at work that just   couldn't understand that my friend was only working four days a week that he wasn't working   full time and he asked my friend what do you do on that day off what do you do on that Friday i   cannot understand why wouldn't you want to work we were laughing about this because we couldn't   understand him how couldn't you appreciate an extra day off where you have extra time   to spend with your family extra time to work on your health extra time to go on adventures extra   time to work on a side project on your hobbies to learn new skills new languages there's so   many things you can do in that one extra day off and i just couldn't understand where he was coming   from why would he ask that and i asked myself why is this but to answer that question first   i need to ask myself why do we work in the first place well usually because of one of three reasons   being play purpose or pressure with pressure i mean economic pressure or emotional pressure   emotional pressure because you have to make your parents proud by becoming a successful lawyer   or doctor and economic pressure because you have to do work to get compensated so you can sustain   yourself and your life either way economic or emotional the motive for work is separate from the   work itself you do the work because you have to not because you like to do it this is actually the   worst reason to work yet ironically this is why most people work now the next motive is purpose   this motive is also separated from the work itself but you do it because you value the outcome and   the results of your work for example a nurse might not like the high stress environment she   works in but what keeps her going is the fact that she's able to help people to heal patients   same reason why people work at a charity and accept the low pay because they have a sense that   they're making a positive impact on the world that they're helping the world purpose is a very strong   motivator to work but it's still not optimal as you don't enjoy the work itself but you value   the outcome of your work and then there is players work play is what occurs when you simply like to   do something the work itself is the reward play is when you play a music instrument when you go on a   hike read a book play video games solve puzzles create videos play is when you're in a state of   flow fueled by curiosity and experimentation and for this reason people intrinsically want   to learn more and improve the work itself is the greatest motive work that feels like play   is the most powerful driver for high performance and consequently success and for success i have   one simple definition doing work that feels like play fulfills a purpose and gets you paid there   is a Japanese term for this Ikigai and there is an Ikigai for everyone if you are not lucky enough to   find your Ikigai in your current workplace then that should be your goal to create a life where   you are doing work motivated by play and purpose i mean why wouldn't you as far as i know we only   have one life that means you have about 50 60 years left to do whatever you want and i get it   if you're currently doing work motivated by pressure this costs a lot of energy both mentally   and physically after a hard day of working because you have to you want to come home and unwind how   are you going to work on building a life fueled by play and purpose if you don't have the energy   nor the time to actually do so this is what people mean when you're stuck in the rat race when you're   stuck in this 905 life but i learned it's what you do in the five to nine that determines the rest   of your life it can take one year five years maybe even 10 years but as long as you don't do anything   you'll end up in exactly the same spot you are in right now it took me about seven years to   give myself at least a shot at living the life i want to live i work my way up from a trainee to an   employer from an employer to a freelancer and from a freelancer to now currently a growing content   creator because i found creating videos and sharing stories feels most like play to me while   fulfilling a purpose and potentially getting paid enough to sustain myself and this is something   i was missing in my job as a data analyst even though there was a little bit of room to express   myself creatively in building dashboards and i got to work with cool colleagues i was missing the   sense of purpose because to be honest it wasn't fulfilling in fact i would sometimes ask myself   why am i actually doing the stuff i'm doing i could never see the positive impact i was making   on society how were my dashboards impacting society and the people around me in a positive way   it wasn't that clear but okay so now that we've learned that a full-time job is not so secure   as you think it is and that ideally you should do work that feels like play how do we actually make   a living out of play this brings me to lesson three back in high school i was around 17 years   maybe i had to make the decision of what i was going to study and therefore what i wanted to be   later on in life what kind of job i wanted to have but the thing is i had no prior work experience   yeah as delivering newspapers and working at a supermarket how was i supposed to know what   study to pick therefore what kind of job i wanted to have for the rest of my life basically i didn't   even know what it meant to have a real job what do you do all day in an office but i just had to make   one of the most important decisions in my life basically impacting the rest of my future based   on no experience and no knowledge so what did i do i just picked a study that sounded interesting the   study itself not the possibilities that i could have after studying and it really felt like i   had to pick this one thing that i was going to do for the rest of my life but nobody told me   about e-commerce nobody told me about drop shipping nobody told me about investing i   didn't know Youtubers were making money i didn't know content creation was a thing nobody told me   that it's not about getting a job and working it's about creating value and getting rewarded for it   you see you can work in a restaurant 80 hours a week but you're not going to get rich because   it's not about working hard it's about offering value and it's simple really we get compensated   proportionally to the amount of value we can bring to society to the world now when i look at myself   over the years i've acquired the skills and the knowledge to become a data analyst since   so much data is generated by companies nowadays companies need to analyze and utilize this data   to get the competitive edge they need data analyst jobs are high in demand but there are just not   enough people to fill up all those jobs good data analysts are scarce and therefore valuable but the   value i have to offer will always be limited by my time there's only so many hours in a day meaning   there's only so many dashboards and reports i can build i get compensated for the amount of hours it   takes me to build a dashboard but once i've built a dashboard and it gets used for weeks months   maybe even years long after i finished building that dashboard i don't get compensated anymore   so i get compensated for the amount of hours i put in into building the dashboard building the report   analyzing the data rather than the value it might bring to the company i get compensated for my   input the amount of hours rather than the output the value my work brings and this is the exact   reason i've quit my job to pursue something where i get rewarded fairly for the amount of value i   bring and not for how many hours i've put in when i create a video on youtube that's not valuable to   the world i don't get a lot of views and i get compensated accordingly i don't get anything   however when i do make a video that's considered valuable maybe it's entertaining or educational   and it does get a lot of views i also get rewarded accordingly it doesn't matter how many hours i've   put into creating both videos i get rewarded for my output not for my input and it gets better   my videos will exist on youtube long after i've created them meaning my videos will be of value to   some people long after i've created them meaning i will get compensated for that value it brings   long after i've created them and it gets even better i can do this at skill i can make one   video that can potentially get viewed by millions of people meaning it can be of value to millions   of people and i get compensated accordingly so my composition is not limited by my time unlike   my data analyst job and unlike the waiter at a restaurant that cannot serve a million tables at   the same time he cannot leverage his skills he cannot scale up the value he's bringing   to the world so do i feel some sense of guilt for quitting a job that a lot of people would consider   a dream job definite but to be honest i would feel more guilty if i would have the opportunity   to build a life that i actually want to live but not do so because that would be a true disgrace to   the people that do not even have the opportunity to build a life they want to live although i think   a lot of people have the opportunity to build the life they want to have but do not realize   so because in fact if you're watching this video that means you have a mobile phone a laptop or a   computer and an internet connection and with those things you can learn almost anything you want   online for free that's what i did i didn't go to film school i didn't know anything about   cameras i just watched a lot of youtube videos i learned everything online picked up a camera   some lenses and started creating videos and i'm trying to build a life based on making   videos is it scary 100 but i'm still gonna do it because as i said i think it's scarier to   know that you have the opportunity to create a life you want to have but choose to not do so   and accept this kind of mediocre life where you're surviving instead of thriving now that   sounds a lot scarier to me than just going for it at least trying so if you're still watching that   means you have a mobile phone that means you have a laptop and an internet connection go for it go   figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life and then go do it go get good at it   and build the life you want i know it sounds cliche i'm getting an emotional here i know   it sounds cliche but if i can do it then you can definitely do it i will be sharing my journey my   struggles and my life lessons on this channel i'm glad to have you on this journey with me cheers over the last five years i've learned length i get rewarded rewarded i get rewarded for the amount of   put into creating both videos videos what the [ __ ] i am starting to become danish is it scary   100 percent but i'm still doing it yeah is there doing it see how confident i am \"], 'senti_emotions': [{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.52}]}\n"

      "{'sentence_ids': [0], 'sentence_text': [\"what's up guys megan here with bearabletraders i want to do a little video about why on earth   someone would leave a career they've spent years building to hop over to something like day trading   something a little bit risky right we see doctors lawyers teachers mechanics dentists you name it   do it all of the time i mean are we absolutely crazy well we might be but aside from that   there are some pretty understandable reasons why a lot of people gravitate towards this industry   let's chat about them but first for those who don't know me or know my background here's a quick   snippet about me i'm a professional chef i've cooked privately in client homes for many years   i started a fine dining pop-up restaurant and i do menu consulting for restaurants and hospitality   groups and there's a decent chance you've seen me on national television so why would someone like   me with a decade spent building a successful career and client roster that has absolutely   no correlation to the stock market whatsoever decide to quit my job to become a day trader   number one there's no ceiling to how much you can make so as an entrepreneur there's typically an   appropriate amount that you can charge a client before it becomes outrageous and they no longer   want to pay for it or they can no longer afford it and with a nine to five like your standard job   there's only so much of a ladder you can climb and so much of a paycheck you can make i really like   not having limits it's very motivating for me plus i've always been a bit of a carver on path kind of   a person and as an added bonus to this not only is there not really a ceiling to how much you can   make but there's also not a lot of overhead so you don't have a lot of staff to pay for   or materials to pay for so your the amount you can make is exponential and the amount you're paying   every month is very very minimal number two it's different every day this isn't the type of job   where you stamp your time card and robotically do the same thing every single day even running   my own business you know where i didn't stamp a time card there were still times that i was   spending back-to-back days doing the exact same thing peeling the same bucket of potatoes cooking   the same dish going to the same client's house and so on and you know now don't get me wrong i do sit   down at my same desk with my same monitors pretty much every day but the market itself is different   so i trade different stocks and the price action is different and there's different news that's   happening like elon musk buys twitter elon musk doesn't buy twitter all these little things and   nuances make each day a unique challenge so if you like a new challenge and you enjoy not doing   the exact same thing every day then i'm sure you'll understand where i'm coming from plus   the learning path is endless there's there are so many different things to learn about the overall   market and strategies that you really can't get bored there's no point at which you say well   i've learned everything i can you'll really never stop learning in this industry and   learning is what keeps our brains alive number three you can do it from literally anywhere   there you know there are certain jobs that you can do remotely and certain jobs that you can't   mine was unfortunately the latter so if i wasn't physically there i was not getting paid   some of my consulting gigs i was able to do from afar but most things were happening in person so   if i went away for a week i couldn't just log in for a couple of hours in the morning do a little   work make some lunch money and carry on with my day instead i basically just didn't get paid and i   love that trading allows me the flexibility to not be chained to one location or even one room in my   house i could just pick my laptop up and go to the kitchen and you know i still get paid and i get   to also continue to be my own boss it's awesome number four the sense of community and growth and   this is a big one for me because before i branched out into the more public eye in the hospitality   world i spend a lot of time in kitchens by myself and so to have people around me that are   like-minded is really just an amazing feeling and on top of that the growth aspect a lot of people   you know in this industry are you know they know that they have to do better to be better they got   to work on their demons so they're all working on themselves sharing ideas and growing together and   i absolutely love that there's you know there's a sense of support and not competition for instance   in a standard career if you got hired and got paid to do a job that position is no longer   available for someone else like if someone hires me to cook for them there's not also they're not   also going to hire another chef the same day so only one of us is going to get paid but in trading   if i make 100 bucks it doesn't mean another trader can't also make 100 bucks because of   this there's absolutely no battling it out for a job or a client everyone in the community   is just sharing ideas bettering themselves growing together and making money number five   it allows me time and flexibility if i want to take a friday off at the last minute i can take   it if i suddenly want to leave town i can leave if something comes up with a family member i can be   there and i just absolutely love the freedom like how could you not love that i mean that   to me is wealth itself like whether i'm making five dollars or a million dollars like the fact   that i have freedom just is it's everything and you know the last one for me personally   and this is just a bonus is that day trading is less physically demanding my god being a chef   is very exhausting my feet man my feet and bonus number two is just just so much damn fun so   whether you choose day trading as a part-time gig or you decide to do it full-time   like myself and many others out there i'm sure we have a lot of things in common but i'd love   to know other reasons why you may have decided to choose this crazy wild ride so drop me a comment   below and let me know and if you liked this video please don't forget to like and subscribe   it helps us out a ton alright you guys thanks so much for watching i'll catch you next time you \"], 'senti_emotions': [{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.39}]}\n"

What is the path to a raise? - I had many career conversations with the senior leader I was working with, and they were always like, \"Oh yeah, of course I will support you.\" And so two months before aperformance review cycle, I popped the question', 'Do you and the leadershipteam feel confident in nominating me for promo this cycle?

this would be pretty disorganized\", 'Now when a company saysbasically come up with a case of why we should promoteyou and prove it to us, the issue here is thatthis creates a lot of bias', 'Typically the people whothen make the best case or are perceived withmore leadership qualities, AKA, people with certain backgrounds, characteristics that are more commonly associated with leaders, then those

putting it onher and skirting around the question of how can she get promoted, what steps are there, because they can\\'t really give any proof that she\\'s a low performer', \"They weren't there to lift the teams and elevate them to the next level\", '- Okay, a manager shouldalways be someone who is in service to their employees,to their team members, making sure that they are being effective', \"That's the entire purpose of a manager\", 'Not to judge performance, ooh', '- Number two, culture', 'To give you a sense of what work is like, TikTok is owned by ByteDance, which is a Chinese company that is about over a 100,000 people', \"You might've heard of996 culture from China, which is working 9:00 AM to9:00 PM, six days a week\", '- 996, so brutal', 'I hear so much of this culture these days of be your own boss, leave the nine to five andbecome an entrepreneur', \"But yet what I see so manypeople do is they leave the nine to five, and whenthey're an entrepreneur, it's like a 996, where they're working around the clock to get their own business up and running\", \"This is my little warning to you of we can find jobs that are exciting, that are going to light youup, that aren't draining, that are not going to make you work around the clock like this\", 'Not necessarily goinginto entrepreneurship is always the right way, unless you have a really sustainable way that you can do entrepreneurship', 'So just a quick plug there', \"- I'd have UK meetingsfrom eight to 10:00 AM and then us meetings from 10 to 6:00 PM, and then Beijing meetingsfrom 7:00 PM to like

the meeting was supposed to start', 'I regularly worked around12 to 16 hours a day, and I really questionedwhether or not I could do this should I ever become a mom', \"- So this is an important point here, is that when you werelooking at job opportunities it's so important to notfocus solely on the title, product manager, or the company, TikTok\", \"That's a brand name\", 'I love using their application', \"I'm passionate about their application\", 'So if one of her values isbeing able to spend time with family and friends andpotentially be a mother someday, this job is in

you're going to bemiserable day in and day out\", '- Outside of the hours, the culture was also a little harsh', \"And I don't mean the lackof happy hours or swag or no meeting days or awards\",

artist', 'And it comes from how pickup artists use emotionally manipulative language to get people to question their reality andthen take advantage of them', 'When translated to the workplace, it refers to when colleaguesand senior managers attack your character and your identity instead of your professional behavior', \"It's kind of like neggingand sometimes gaslighting\", 'I learned that it washappening to me on a number of occasions and I felt crazy', 'I cried a lot', 'People I thought I shouldhave trusted had said some really hurtful things, and it sucked', \"- Yeah, this is a common thing I've seen with a lot of employees\", 'You are told by peoplewho have higher status, who have maybe have years and years more experience than you, that you are missing a gap,that you are not competent', '- Number three, diversity', 'Big surprise', 'There was a significant lack of women and BIPOC representation in the managerial and leadership roles', \"I mentioned that earlierthat when I do become a mom I wouldn't be able to work here, and I think a lot of peoplehad the same thought\", \"- Okay, so that's a really important point that is made many times over in industries like tech and consulting\", 'One of the best solutionsis to really build a more balanced culture', \"Even if you look at studiesof employee productivity, there's actually a ceiling ofproductivity after a certain amount of hours to whereit's not advantageous to continue working people to the bone\", 'So that goes to show howmuch turnover there is', \"And it's so much better to have employees for long amounts of time\", \"You don't have to retrain people\", 'The retention and then they keep all of that internal knowledge', \"It's a better practice to make sure that your company is thriving\", '- I went to first womanin product session, I decided to share myexperiences of negging and being gaslit, and Ijust ended up balling', 'It was a really vulnerable moment for me', \"And a couple of them

of somethingbeing insensitive or off is seen as an isolated incident', \"And so while yes, thepeople who are impacted can speak up and that's extremely brave, I understand why they don't always do it\", \"So what's so important isfor all of us to take classes on diversity, equity, inclusion,read books, do research, understand what are the signs, so that we're, first of all, we're not contributing to the problem\", 'And second of all, that we are intervening when we see things like this happening', '- Number four, health', 'Yes, TikTok is notorious for having really intense work cultureas you can see online', \"And I'm getting to the agewhere I can no longer stand it\", 'I actually think Ideveloped a sleep disorder from working so late into the evenings', 'But especially knowing thatthe majority of the company is awake when I amsupposed to be sleeping, gives me so much anxiety', 'So I work on the west coast, even just having people on the east coast getting their day startedthree hours before me, I always wake up and Ikind of am in a flurry', \"And what's so important to note is like I was saying earlier, it's so important that we're choosing jobs that will

unwittingly on the market as a result of massivelayoffs that companies are doing without any effective retentionstrategies for that top talent, but they will even sit on the market ifthey don't have

you'renot going to be expected to work, and they definitely don't want you logginginto their CRM after you've handed in your notice\", 'So if you do have anypersonal assets on your work computer, for some reason, say youremail or local files, make sure that you take thoseoff and get those to yourself', 'The other thing that I wanted to reallymake sure that you knew by the end of this video is to make sure thatyou are making a gracious exit', \"I know that when you hate your job, when you're marchinginto your boss' office or into the zoom to put in your notice, and especially if you don'thave another job lined up, it is really tempting to godown in a blaze of glory, resist this temptation,be gracious in your exit\", 'Because the way that you leave anorganization says we more about you than the way that they have treatedyou, no matter the amount of respect, appreciation, and growth opportunitythey have, or have not given to you', 'And at the end of the day, yourprofessional brand is everything', \"You don't want to burn it down, especially if it's for somejob that you don't like, for some company that you can stand, for some jerk boss that you reallyhope you never have to see again\", \"ow I'd love to know from you\", 'Have you ever quit a job beforehaving another job lined up? Let me know in the comments, if you have', \"One more bonus question that I actuallywanted to throw into this is that the job just isn't for you\", 'When I was working at a recruitmentagency, I had a wonderful team, a boss that I was learning so much from', \"And I was from a metricsperspective, doing pretty well, but the job really wasn't for me\", 'So as incredible as it was, honestly, it felt like it was sucking mysoul and I needed to get out', \"So in the middle of the great recession, I walked into my boss's office on aMonday morning and I put in my notice\", 'Even though I was extremelyaware of the market that I was walking into, sometimes you do need to make a leap offaith in yourself that things are going to work out', 'If you are interested in deepdiving into ways that

      "{'sentence_ids': [0], 'sentence_text': [\"hey guys what's up it's Jerome and I know it's been a couple of days since I last uploaded more like two and a half years so sorry about that but I figured it's about time for me to   catch you guys on what I've been doing for the last two and a half years and what I'm planning   on doing in the future I graduated from college I got a job as an electrical engineer I moved from   Knoxville and as you can see I bought a ton of shoes so that's that's pretty cool right no but   but seriously I bought all of these so anyway as you can see from the title I've got some pretty   big news and that's that I'm quitting my job and what am I gonna go do well I have decided   to take on a lot of debt and go back to school to get my MBA so just give you guys a little   bit of background on why I'm doing this I guess I need to walk you through the last two half years   since since I haven't posted anything you guys don't know anything about what I've been doing   last two and half years I graduated from college like I already said got a degree in electrical   engineering and you know I always had internships all my internship experiences were good they were   interesting enough but I always felt like something was missing and to be completely   honest with you I felt like being an Indian there was a lot of pressure from the community from just   people at school from myself to be an engineer or be a doctor or be a lawyer or whatever but   to be completely honest with you I felt like I've always been more interested in finance   and money and how the stock market worked and how to invest your money I always tried to do things   like that kind of on my own but I was also kind of embarrassed to admit that and so I just kept   doing the engineering thing and I decided to get a minor in business administration so that way I   could still learn a little bit about the finance side but I was really interested in but I kept too   Engineering thing so as time went on we got into the first semester senior year of college and all   my friends were starting to get job offers from everyone I really didn't know what I wanted to do   and so I thought the natural next progression for me was to get my master's degree in engineering so   I started applying to a bunch of master's programs and I even got into one at the University of Texas   at Austin which at the time was the number nine electrical engineering program in the country   I was interviewing for a bunch of internships that semester and I remember during one of my   interviews one of the interviewers asked me why are you getting a master's degree if you know you   can do the same job and get paid the same amount with just your bachelor's degree I didn't answer   the question I literally stared at this guy for at least 30 seconds mouth open he must have thought   that I was the biggest idiot on earth but to be honest with you I had no idea I knew that I didn't   really enjoy engineering but I just thought it was the right thing to do and like I said a bunch   of my friends were already getting job offers anywhere between like sixty-five seventy five   thousand dollars a year which as a 21 year old at the time that's a lot of money honestly for anyone   that's a lot of money so I kept asking myself why am I going and putting myself more in debt to get   this master's degree when I know engineering doesn't really make me happy and here's this   interviewer who's telling me I can get the same amount of pay with just my bachelor's degree I   had an internship already lined up at the time I called them and I said hey I don't think I'm   gonna come for the internship because instead I'm gonna work full-time I kind of thought that it was   gonna be a bridge burned when I said I wasn't gonna come for the internship but instead they   invited me out they interviewed me they really liked me still so they offered me a full-time   position so my girlfriend and I we packed all of our stuff from Knoxville we moved here to Johnson   City and I started working at Eastman Chemical Cup in kingsport I got this weird vein in my   forehead that I can see on camera and while the experience has been really great um like I said   before it just didn't get me excited I didn't feel like I was doing what I should be doing and I just   had that nagging thought in the back of my mind that man I should be doing something different   at first I thought maybe I just don't like working for a chemical company and so I applied to a bunch   of other jobs I actually got to the last round and a couple of them and when I got invited out   to the headquarters for my final interview I again turned it down because I felt like why am I going   through this process again I know I don't wanted to continue doing engineering I finally took the   leap of faith and I applied to a bunch of MBA programs and after applying all those schools   I got rejection after rejection after rejection and I was really starting to lose hope that I was   gonna go back and get my MBA until finally I got that one acceptance letter you only need one and   I got accepted into University of North Carolina's kenan-flagler Business School now before you think   this was a really easy decision I can tell you it definitely was not you can do a very quick google   search and figure out how much the MBA at UNC costs and if you don't want to I'll just tell   you the entire program cost about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars and that's just tuition   that's not living expenses that's not anything else and we can talk about that stuff in a later   video if you guys want to but yeah it's it's not easy to make that decision and because of copán   19 things have gotten even more complicated with everything going on UNC's already kind of adjusted   what they're doing in terms of their MBA program originally they were supposed to start classes at   the end of July beginning of August now they're gonna be starting at the end of August beginning   of September so we're already losing about a month's worth of just in classroom experience   there they also announced all of their recruiting and networking events are going to be virtual and   so I'm not gonna have that face-to-face contact with recruiters that I was originally planning   on having and this isn't just for UNC either for instance Harvard actually said that they're   gonna have 200 less MBA students this year than they did last year for whatever reason whether   students want don't want to participate in a virtual format maybe international students   couldn't get a visa because of covin or whatever the reason might be so obviously all that makes   this a really difficult decision on the one hand I really want to go back to school follow what   I think is my passion and on the other hand do I want to spend that kind of money to get this   program when it seems like because of kovat and everything that's going on you're not really going   to give that full traditional MBA experience like you would have gotten if you started in   last year or the year before or maybe even if you wait a year and start next year for me right now   I'm still planning on going in the fall because even though the networking and recruiting events   are gonna be virtual I still think having that in-class in-person experience for the academic   side of it will really be worth it and I'm just ready to go ahead and pursue what I think my   passion is so why am I telling you guys this right now and making this video well to be completely   honest with you I've done a lot of research on what I need to do to transition from you know   working as an engineer to going back to school and getting a career in finance and there's a lot of   really good information out there there is but when you go down and specify engineer to MBA or   engineer to finance there's not a lot of stuff there's not really very many articles or videos   or anything really available so I figured hey if I had those questions and I tried to look it up   surely other people have tried to look it up too so maybe I can be the one to record it and put my   experience on here so in the future someone else can look at this and be like oh that's that's a   realistic expectation to have while going through this experience of going from engineer to NBA and   hopefully I'll be posting a lot more soon so if you guys want to stay updated on that and what I'm   gonna be doing in preparation for my MBA how it goes and all that stuff please make sure to like   this video and subscribe to the channel so you don't miss anything thanks talk to you guys later \"], 'senti_emotions': [{'Happy': 0.12,

And so this example specifically really openedmy eyes to how many people in this world actually use up so many of their glory years workingon things that they don't love, going to jobs that they hate, only to retire at 65 and enjoywhat's left\", \"But the problem is that by the time you're65, your body and your mind are not going to be as youthful as it is right now\", 'And by being so scared of this concept iswhat really motivated me to start now', 'Yes, it might take a while to make a livingout of something that I love doing', \"But I'd rather spend the next five, 10 yearsdoing that, than spend the next 40 years working on something that I already know is not forme\", \"The second major take away from Tim Ferriss'sbook is that it taught me the importance and the power of being an owner versus an employee,or even being a boss\", 'But truly rich and wealthy people, they aspireto be owners', 'Would you rather be the employee that workson the train serving the food, or manning the tickets, or, the boss that actually hasto make sure that the train runs on time', 'Or, would you rather be the owner of the actualtrain and have the employee and the boss do the work for you, and making sure that thetrain is operating well? I think that once Tim Ferriss really brokedown these examples between truly wealthy people versus average people, it really litup this entrepreneurial bug inside of me, and inspired me so much to do my own thingand to strive to be an owner, not just in business, but also in my life', 'And so before I move on to the next book,I also want to give a lot of credit to Tim Ferriss', 'I think Tim Ferriss played a huge role inmy journey of leaving the rat race and starting my own business', 'Essentially, in a nut shell, those two booksfeature over 100 of the worlds top performers, and each section of the book, really digsdeep into the philosophies of these people, their lifestyle, their habits', 'And these people also give their businessand financial advice in these books', 'And so by reading these books that also openedmy mind to what was truly possible in my life, and also gave me a tribe of mentors and atribe of people that I may not know, but really coached me through this time in my life', \"The second book that I want to give a shoutout to is Danielle Laporte's Desire Map\", 'This book really helped me be more in tunewith my intuition, and gave me the inspiration to follow my gut, and to lead a life thatis more intentional', \"Essentially what Danielle Laporte teachesin the Desire Map is that, a lot of times, a lot of people, we set goals based on materialobjects, material items, material experiences, just external things that don't necessarilyreally mean anything\", \"Because at the end of the day, yes, we'retrying to chase these external goals, but what we're really searching for is the feelingthat we hope we'll get by attaining these goals\", \"But really, what that truly means is thatby having that six figure salary, what we're really hoping for is that we hope to feelvalidated, we hope to feel powerful, we hope to feel a sense of freedom\", 'So essentially in a nut shell, what this bookreally taught me is to set goals not just based on external things like, starting myown business, being on Forbes 30 under 30, or being a VP of whatever company', 'It really taught me to set goals based onthe feelings that I want to achieve in my life', 'For instance, the major three goals that Ihave in my life is to feel alive', 'And when I actually narrow down these threefeelings that I want to achieve in my life, I realized that the job I was doing in myprevious Fortune 500 company, none of those things I was doing in my day-to-day job actuallymade me feel alive, purposeful nor creative', \"And that's when I knew that there was a hugemisalignment between what my actual goals were, and what I wanted in my life, versuswhat I was doing right now\", 'It also allowed me to tap into what I trulywanted and understanding my why for doing thing', 'Not only all of these things, it also helpedme find careers or find opportunities that would actually make me feel good, that wouldactually make me feel more alive, more purposeful, and more creative', 'During that time in my life when I was questioningwhether or not to leave my job, podcasts were a life saver', 'And I would spend all my mornings while Iwas doing my make up listening to episodes', \"Even during my commute to work, I would belistening to podcasts, or as I was walking home after work, I'd be listening to podcasts\", 'And so podcasts, really changed the way thatI consume content', \"It also gave me inspiration that I didn'treally know I needed\", \"The first podcast that really changed thegame for me is a podcast called, Don't Keep Your Day Job, by Cathy Heller\", 'This podcast is literally perfect for anyonewho is contemplating leaving their job', \"This whole podcast's focus is basically forpeople who are in this stage in their lives\", 'What I love most about this podcast is notonly does Cathy Heller interview people who have quit their jobs and followed differentpaths in their lives, but she also introduces experts onto the show to actually talk aboutthe psychology of leaving, advice that they would give', \"It's not just fluffy stuff, it's actual tangiblestuff that might help you and inspire you to take to leap yourself\", \"For anyone who is considering leaving theirjobs or needs such inspiration or needs that advice, I highly recommend Cathy Heller'sDon't Quit Your Day Job podcast\", \"The second podcast that indirectly basicallyhelped me quit my job is NPR's How I Built This\", \"I think a lot of people know this podcast,it's a very popular one, but I can't stress enough how amazing this podcast truly is\", \"If you don't know this podcast, essentially,each episode actually focuses on the founders of some of the world's biggest companies\", 'But not only do they talk about business orentrepreneurship and everything like that, but what I love most about this podcast isthat it really focuses on the story', 'And I think that that is what makes this podcastamazing, because you can actually see the struggles that these entrepreneurs went through', 'The risks that they had to take, their backstory, the decisions, their set backs, their failures, everything', \"I think that this podcast, very similar toTim Ferriss's book, is what truly ignited that entrepreneurial bug inside of me\", 'But also what this podcast did is, give methe courage to relentlessly chase after my dreams and to not give up and to have thatpersistence', 'Because as I was listening to all the episodes,one of the key things that all these successful founders have is persistence, and also a veryclear vision not backing down on that vision', \"And so, NPR's How I Built This, is a greatpodcast if you want that daily dose, or that weekly dose of inspiration of how other peoplehave made a living doing what they love and fighting for what they want in their lives\", 'Last but not least, the third podcast thatreally gave me the courage to ditch the nine to five', 'Kelly Track is actually a boss babe that Iwas lucky enough to go to university with', 'When she launched the podcast, I listenedto many of her episodes', 'A lot of her episodes, especially in the earlierstages of her podcasts, really focused on her journey, and her mindset of how she tookthe leap in order to pursue entrepreneurship, and how she took the leap to let go of SiliconValley, and how she took the leap to let go of corporate', 'She has done a lot of cool things in her lifeand her story is incredibly inspiring', 'One of my favorite episodes of hers on thepodcast is an episode called, \"Quitting is Underrated.\" I\\'ll link the show in my description in thisvideo, because I truly think that if you are someone who has a lot of anxiety about howpeople will label you if you quit because trust me, I had that', \"I was so scared of being called a quitter,I didn't want that to ruin my reputation, I just didn't want people to think that Ijust gave up and I'm not a good worker, that I'm not a hard worker\", 'This episode really changed my perspectiveon why quitting is actually okay', \"Kelly's podcast is also great if you wantto tap into the spiritual side of you\", \"I think that Kelly's podcast really kind ofgot my feet wet into law of attraction, manifestation, the universe, finding alignment in your life\", 'I think that her podcast is a great resourceif you wanted to get your feet wet into that of spirituality', 'She has some episodes, especially the onesthat are pertaining to her story, how she took the leap', 'They are incredibly inspirational, and I highly,highly could not recommend it anymore than I already have', 'And truly changed my perspective on quitting,and leaving and a job that was no longer serving me', 'I hope that by watching this video, you decideto pick up one of the books, or take a listen to one of the podcasts and I ope it changesyour life too', \"And if not, then I hope that you don't giveup on this journey to find your true life's purpose\", \"That being said, I hope you guys have an amazingday, I hope you guys have an amazing week, I hope you guys have an amazing life, andI'll see you in the next one\"], 'senti_emotions': [{'Happy': 1.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.0, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.0}, {'Happy':

gentlemen and everybody in between i'm back   for another vulnerable get ready with me clink clink clink we're back for another get ready with me and i'm super duper duper excited because   this was a little bit different we're going to be doing obviously my get ready with me always are   like a two in one we do a wig we do makeup now the wig the hair y'all see this hair i love this bomb   i have to be honest when i first saw it i was like hmm how is this going to look on me cute it's cute   girl the way the way this wig came is it really is pull it out the box and go sort of weak the   face is an all-stick foundation sort of look so very much giving oh very much giving skin you see   wow this get ready with me is it perfectly links with this week now let me tell you something   i have been on youtube for seven years i have been doing wig reviews for seven years in all   seven of those years this wig brand is has been one of my gold brands to work with   i i don't know why i feel like i'm about to cry again why am i so emotional today oh   i already know you already know what time it is i felt like if i worked with this brand i made it   i want to say thank you to rpg hair for providing this wig to me and sponsoring this portion of this   video i'm so elated to do this wig review and they did not disappoint i've been on youtube for seven   years and i quit my job nine months ago to be a full-time youtuber and social media influencer   and in this get ready with me we're going to chat about how it's been going so far and   just some advice that i've learned since quitting my job so because how many months did i say it's   been a whole gestational period girl it's been nine months i have a few little tips just from   little on me girl don't don't be acting like grass little on me i don't know nothing if you want to   see a little bit more information about this beautiful hair and you want to get a coupon code   a coupon code with my name on it girl i've arrived please keep on watching and i'll be back   let's get into some girl top and do this face now let's go ahead and pop this box open your wig   comes in the rpg hair wig box inside that box of course these are the gifts i received a baby hair   brush a rat tail comb some flyaway balm and an elastic bag band that you're able to remove and of   course a service card now of course this is your wig this is the ombre bob curly lace frontal wig   it is 14 inches long 180 density and this hairline is giving friend look at this hairline it has a   bleach hairline hd lace and a clean hairline which means it's pre-plucked and ready to go flattened   for you friend so we're gonna do our ball cap method now my ball cap method ain't your ball cap   method we got different ball cap methods because my ball can't mess at me i don't do nothing girl   you probably gonna see my recap through this but we're gonna fix it towards the end so i just do a   wig grip as well as a wig cap over it and that's it but as you can see this hairline is giving so   i'm gonna use some lace tint um the lace is hd but i always like to tip my lace i use the calendar   lace tint and i just spray it down and blow dry it with a blow dryer on warm to set in   the color now look at it now it looks real good it's going to melt into the skin very very well   but the first thing i need to do is re-flatten the hairline because when i blow dry it just be   freezing the thing up so we need to get this thing back where she needed to be so i'm going to use my   andes hot comb just to go ahead and lay her down a bit and get her re-flattened to her original state so look at that it look real pretty it looks really really flat and all i need to do is cut off   this lace girl we are halfway there so when i'm cutting off my lace i like to use my annie shears   and i'm just going to pull back the hair just so i don't chop off a whole side of my wig and now   i got an asymmetrical wig i don't want that so i just clip the hair back and i'm going around   the ears and i'm cutting off a little bit of the hair on the side because it hangs over my ears a   little bit so i got a tiny head so y'all know the caps a little bit bigger also cut some of   the hair off the front as well so in order to apply the wig we're going to use the wig dealer   spray now this wig dealer spray is amazing if you haven't tried her i would say try her out   i'll leave a link for it down below but it gets real real sticky and we're gonna do two   layers of the wig dealer spray we're just gonna lay this wig down   and y'all watch as my scalp trim okay let me get my words right watch as my scalp transforms   transforms what am i going through so i'm going to use the back of the rat tail comb just to   go ahead and melt that in a little bit this was super super duper easy to apply but to make sure   this lace actually melted melted down i spray over the lace just to make sure   nothing is lifting up and we're completely melting into the skin and i want y'all to look at these it   looks so good now you know i wouldn't be me if i do no little teeny tiny little infant hairs   on my wig so i like for my baby hairs to be really tiny and instead of using gel to lay them down   because that's what i used to do i'm going to use the wig dealer spray now this is a little   bit harder but it gives a much softer look and let me tell you something the way they pre-plug   this wig it makes the baby hairs look so natural now you know that you got a good pre pluck wig   when your baby hairs are really really fine and they look super natural and i like mine to look   you know like more like just edges and less like baby hairy because they just don't be   looking right on my forehead so i like to do four sets of baby hairs i only like to   do bow i would like to just do two on the ear tabs and then two like basically on my temples   one thing i like about doing baby hairs on the ear tabs is it stops the ear tabs from popping up as   much so as you can see that has been laid down and all we have to do is melt it into the hairline i   like to use and what do you call this elastic band just to lay it down and get it really really flat   next we're going to do this hair now one thing i noticed about this hair is because it is colored   it seems like it's a little bit drier so we needed to add a little moisture in this thing   just to get this hair going now you can wear this hair right out of the box but y'all know me   i always got to do a little bit too much just to get a little bit out of it so i'm going to use my   shea moisture mousse just to go ahead and apply the mousse to the hair and encourage these curls   to keep going so i'm going to use my evol 572 brush and i'm just going to brush through the hair   just to make these curls clump together and encourage the curls to look less more like less   like machine curls and more like natural curls if you know what i mean so i'm using the coconut   curls what was this called um what i call it it's the coconut curls ors ogx ogx coconut curls   dry cream i don't think i should have used that on this hair i should have just left it with the   mousse but you know i always do too much so i'm just going to continue using the mousse   and comb through the hair with my 572 brush just to clump together the curls at the top i started   doing some finger coiling just to encourage the curls to clump together a little bit more   and you couldn't see it but i was trimming off the ends this bob seemed more asymmetrical y'all   know i'm not asymmetrical girl i'm a straight bob sort of girl so i decided to just clip off   the ends on the front a little bit just so this is a more of this is more of an even   bob so i can get more fullness if you know what i mean you see oh it's going to be so   cute now i'm going to go ahead and use my dyson blow dryer and i'm just going to diffuse   this hair dry now i diffused on really really high heat because girl was brushing i was trying   to hurry up and get this dry because drying curly hair does take a minute especially when you clump   the curls together so i dried it in about maybe 30 minutes and after that i wanted to   reveal the hairline and look at that hairline baby it is melted the only thing i need to do   was cover up that cap i used my stick foundation in nc50 just to cover up the cap that's showing   up around the baby hair parts um and that did a pretty good job now you can kind of see it but   if you too close girl back up give me 50 feet you don't need to be that close we just flattened the   middle part and that's it girl we didn't have to do much now if you do the ball cap method   girl you were in there like swimwear i don't know if anybody says that anymore but you are in there   now now we can go ahead and separate the curls as you can see they're fully clumped together and   that's just how i like it now a couple of them were still wet i probably should have let them   dry a little bit longer but girl my patience was wearing then so i did separate the curls   now i could still tell that i probably needed oil or something to moisturize the ends because   it still felt a little bit drier but once i separated the curls and fluffed the hair out   this was the look and i'm telling you i was obsessed my husband loved it i was walking   around like girl this is me this is my hair so if you would like to purchase this wig i'll   leave a link for it down below i'll also leave my coupon code for ten dollars off down below it   is a mirror bob for ten dollars off now let's go ahead and get into doing this natural face okay y'all let's get started with doing the face the hair is done we got ourselves a cute little   curly bob now we can go ahead and get started with the face and what do i want to talk about i want   to give an update on leaving my job why am i so nervous but i want to give you all an update on   leaving corporate for social media i left my job in october it is august july august it's been nine   months it's been a full gestational period and a lot of things have grown and changed   and i wanted to give y'all like just like a little update how that was going because whoo the face   that i'm gonna do is mostly like stick foundations this is a uh foundation routine that i used   to do when i went into the office let me start with one of my bases already moisturized i use   almost all origins products because my face has been going through it friend   i had a breakout after coming back from vegas and it took me forever to get rid of those bumps on my   forehead but as you can see they're gone and basically i had to stop using vitamin c okay   y'all know i like to use a headband to get the hair out the way now we can go ahead and   start with the base for the face now i'm gonna use the unseen sunscreen super goop   spf it feels like a um primer oh my face is greasy i probably should have removed some of that grease   because my face is green see that's okay on top of this um super goop unseen sunscreens   i'm gonna use the nyx bear with me prime set and refresh eight hour hydration spray i wonder if why do i make that face let me make it cuter okay so while my face dries down   i'm gonna tell y'all what i'm gonna use for the face and i'm just gonna go ahead and apply it   i'm gonna use the bobbi brown stick foundation in golden skin for under the eyes to highlight   for bronzing i'm going to use the the bobbi brown walnut skin foundation stick as a contour and then   for like the areas of my face that just need some correcting i'm going to use the   mac studio fix soft matte stick foundation in the color nc 50\", \"i already talked about why i   left corporate so i was in corporate for about eight years i'm gonna start oh girl that's luck don't tug at the skin and i left because first i have been doing youtube for i think   six years and it's been i've always had to balance doing youtube and working   so i left because well girl it was a lot of work to do both and eventually i started making more   doing this and i was stopping myself from making money working full-time then you know versus you   know going into the office making an hourly pay doing as much work as i was doing i was remote so   i was working from home but even then i couldn't i couldn't balance the two i think it's hard to   explain how much work it is not only to be a social media influencer but somebody that does   wigs it just takes a lot more labor and wigs was my main promotion so when i started doing youtube   i started it back in what 2015 was it 2015 yes it was 2015\", \"when i started doing wigs so back   then um i mean i knew i could get uh i could get paid off of youtube but i didn't know how much   it was and i still was on a path of having a career and being a clinical mentor counselor   and still working in corporate and entertaining that as well so i was thinking like i've always   had multiple jobs i was always doing that so i was thinking like oh i could do this for a minute i   could balance working incorporate in doing youtube and going to school at that time to get my master   masters but eventually i stopped going to school and then eventually i chose to leave   corporate which is the best choice i ever made because girl things are going great   that's what i need to get back to girl was going on and on let's go ahead and blend this   with the sonia kashuk sponge i think for me leaving corporate was the best choice i ever made   because first i'm a much happier person i'm gonna tell y'all right now i was   up i was my attitude was terrible working in corporate it was bad um i'm sorry to   to the people that i knew i was happy unhappy and corporate i'm a person that likes control   and there was little to no control working in corporate you can try and work your way up the   ladder but you can get into a position think it's going to be one thing and then it ends up being   something else and the next thing you know you are stressed out you're tired and you're stuck so   for me i didn't like that so i ended up when i left it was the best choice i made   i was immediately much calmer my anxiety went down all of that now i've been doing this for   what seven years doing youtube for seven years but now that i'm doing it full time i've noticed a   couple things i love doing youtube but i will say this i think what i think one thing that people   make it seem like is doing social media is soft life you know what i'm saying like no   if i think being successful in social media especially as a black woman is um a little   bit more complicated especially on what you do but i think the amount of labor that is expected   of black women is much higher i'm just going to say it i think the way social media the social   media landscape is now especially on youtube there's so many people doing that work that   they almost have to people have to find you so if you are looking into um doing youtube or doing um   anything social media i do think you know you do have to keep in mind that this is not   something that is guaranteed you just won't have one video that pops off   that's very rare that it happens i didn't have a video that popped off that was like okay   i'm here i made it now i can quit my job if you quit your job as soon as you uh pop off on social   media i think it's a terrible idea i there are some people that say like oh yeah you should do it   chase it you know when you get successful when you have a viral video just go   no i think social media is i'm running my mouth and i hope all of this makes sense   i think social media is an amazing tool to use to get to where you need to be but i would say invest   a lot of time research all of that before you choose to do this full-time because it is not easy   and it's not consistent that's one thing that i've learned i've known that that's why i kept my job   all these years i'm gonna add a little bit more coverage under my eyes i've kept my job because   i you know as a woman in my 30s i wasn't looking for instant great i'm looking for stability so   stability was important to me and if if i didn't have stability and consistency i wouldn't have   quit my job it just wouldn't have happened i held on probably much longer than i needed to if you   were looking to be a social media influencer keep your job invest your time or con consistently do   both find time to do both and be realistic with the time that you have commit to your job do well   at your job because you never know what can happen i'm gonna use uh the mac nc50 foundation i just   put it on the flat part of the sponge and i'm just pressing it in how it's going right now is   great but i right now because i'm trying to find a schedule i'm trying to find a schedule on how to   when to upload stuff like that i don't even do as much as some of these other girls do and i'll be   trying to figure out how do y'all find the time but i literally work six and a half days a week   no days off ever not one and if i take a day off girl it messes up everything um social media   is a machine that requires you to engage with it as much as possible to get the best output to get   the best growth to get youtube recommendations uploading three times a week and being consistent   is really really really really really important you don't have to but i do think it's recommended   to at least do once a week but like depending on your type of content my type of content i   have to do like three times a week so far this is looking good friend i'm adding a little bit   more um contour around the nose i'm gonna add some contour on the eyelids because i'm not trying to   do eyeshadow um like i said i've been doing this for seven years and i didn't chase getting   subscribers i'm gonna tell y'all something right now oh let me get my power if you chase subscriber   count you're gonna be selling yourself short i'm gonna use the laura mercier um translucent   powder i think this is too light for my skin tone but i'm gonna use it anyway i'm gonna use   it to set under my eyes and around the mouth but i think people set themselves up by trying to chase views and subscribers views are important but i think what's most important is um   finding a subject matter that you like that you can see that a population cares about   so if you're gonna start a youtube channel like for me i've always loved wigs i've worn wigs   since i was 18 years old so this was organic to me um so coming on youtube and doing wigs was like   it's because i loved it i still had my first video on this channel   i just did a wig video because i found a cute wig and i wanted to tell you all about it and then i   followed it up like with more videos about hair that i loved um oh i need to go into the question   that the girl asked me because it connects to this i the question was asked in my q a   about any tips for micro influencers what does she ask okay so it was kiana h they answered this   question and i promised you i was gonna answer this question she asked i'm curious about how   you went about securing wig collaborations with various companies i can see that a lot of time   hard work and editing goes into your youtube videos without giving away any industry secrets   what's the process like when you're being sponsored by a company versus just putting out   your own youtube content so first um i didn't start wigs for sponsor content until maybe   let's say years years into doing youtube i can't even remember the amount of time but i've been   doing sponsor content for five years how it started was i was doing wig reviews for free   i think mine started with uh like synthetic wig videos and then i moved on to um like human hair   videos and i think my first video i got paid like 50 or something like that for a sponsorship and   how it started was i started with first buying my own wigs i was spending all of my husband's   money there was a point in time where i quit all of my jobs and i was like real sad at home and uh   i think i had a part-time job at this time i was spending money on wigs to do reviews on them so   i spent money on hair anyway like that was always girl when i was in school it was uh y'all remember   you get your check from school from your your loan refund and i would spend my money on hair okay   and then i would come to youtube and i would do reviews on it eventually brands if you leave your   information on your page wig brands will reach out to you okay even the ones on amazon that were   like hey if you do a review i will i've never done that before because i i don't like that um   but they'll reach out to you and say hey do you want to do a review for free and i'll send you   free hair i was happy with that because girl was spending so much money on hair so i started doing   that and then after that i think i had one wig brand that reached out to me and was like hey   you know well i finally gave them a rate and they paid it no 75 dollars i think that was my first   wig review was like 75 bucks my blush be blushing baby oh my god why don't y'all tell me this is   too much yeah i started off doing that and then once they started reaching out to me   basically the wig brands start to reach out to you you also cause i've seen gina jeanine say this   you can reach out to those brands yourself you see a brand you say hey if you send me   some free hair once you start to get a following maybe 500 1000 subscribers   you can start reaching out to them we're just saying hey i'll do it for free   because once you do it for free other brands will see you now there's a certain point where you   you start to get taken advantage of um and you have to figure out where that is based   on your analytics and your engagement and all that type of stuff you can see whether or not   you're not getting enough out of it and you should start charging a rate you can basically start   seeing that by how many people are reaching out to you like if you get a lot of people reaching   out to you then it's like okay i need to start charging a fee that's how you go from free to like   getting paid she asked what's the process like when you're being sponsored by a company versus   putting out your own youtube content when i do my reviews i'd like to give y'all as much information   as possible so you can figure out whether or not you want to purchase it i'm not trying to   sell it to you okay i just want you to know like this is what the wig is like this is what you get   as you can see i'm very detailed in my reviews the only thing that is a different process is writing   down all the information that the brand wants me to say it's usually all the details for the wig   and if they're promoting like a certain part of the week like if it's clear lace   if it's this if it's that then i'll have to let y'all know that type of stuff but other than that   there really girl that isn't really much of a difference i do think i have more fun with   doing my own wig reviews because i only have to think about what i want to do not what the   brain wants which is you know also important you also because you're working with somebody   so there really isn't really much of a different process like i have my notes in front of me   for this week i also have notes for like the other ways that i review so it's kind of like   i've noticed for me when i'm working with brands there isn't they don't have like a lot of requests   there isn't really there isn't any industry secrets wig reviews or wig reviews child really   is no you could see that most people do their wig reviews the same way for me um especially with my   full dedicated wig reviews that are just about the wigs i tried to be so detailed it is painful   those videos take four to six hours to film because i try and like show y'all beginning to   end what the hair is like so it takes like four to six hours like a video like this will take about   from beginning to end let's see i started at 11 it's now 2 35 so this will take about four hours   the other one would take about six like it's four to six it'd be taking a long time already with   these wig videos the great ain't for the faint of heart what was i about to say did i get far off   subject i think i go back to what was i talking about i can't see i need a i need a rubric or i   need to do something or nothing at all because i can't be i don't know what i'm talking about okay   so i'm gonna go ahead and set the face using the lip bar um palette i'm gonna set this is the boss   moves palette i'm gonna use this blush in this bronzer to set the face i wonder if i want to   use this or like the honeymoon powder i use this because it's quicker so let me use my blush first this is pretty i do think um i do want to like for those of you that are looking to be to quit   your job and be influencers um like i said take your time and research the business side don't   just research doing um youtube and how much money you can make it's all about what's the business   what is working with brands whatever brand you whatever business you want to get into if you   do want to do sponsorships because not everybody just sponsorships you can be a commentary channel   whatever you want to do research the business side if you're looking to make a living   getting paid off adsense girl ain't gonna do it adsense is basically like the ads on your video   most people don't make money off that i would say like if you're looking to do collaborations and   sponsorships look into figuring out like what lane can you be in what brands can you work with if   your lifestyle what are you open to working with what do you like what you don't like what makes   you unique all that type of stuff also for the businesses on the business side figure out like   writing how to write an email to a brand how to pitch yourself and also how to create a media kit   that's really really important all that stuff i do think   on your journey to becoming full-time i think it's important to verse yourself in that even if you   get to a point where you blow up and you're like okay i want to hire somebody to manage me you want   to know how they're going to be doing their job so you can look over them because people get screwed   over by management all the time and sometimes you can do that stuff yourself because i did   mine by myself for many many years many many many years i know a lot of people say do what you like   i'm gonna disagree with that but with a little bit i'm gonna disagree with just doing what you   like i think doing what you like is important but i also think researching doing what you like is   important so research if you like to make coffee like what type of coffee videos are really really   popular you can do that within your range of things that you like to do find your audience   like people say your audience will find you they don't always find you because social media is very   very saturated and there's a lot of people that do what you do but you want to make sure what   you do is different from what they're doing you know what i'm saying so your audience not   only you're finding them but they're finding you you're meeting each other you're becoming soul   mates find your niche but then look up like what what are people looking up within my niche like   are people looking up how to make certain types of coffee you know what i'm saying like what is their   favorite sort of coffee can i recreate this or whatever i do think it's important to do research   i think just doing youtube off of vibes or doing social media off of vibes if you have a goal of   being doing it full time and making a living off of it i think it requires um more research   i'm putting on my earrings from amazon i think it requires more research do it to find your audience   and then go from there what was a motivator for me in the beginning of doing social media   and doing youtube people don't watch your videos when you put up your first second third video that   is amazing you do not want nobody watching your first video because most likely it's gonna be bad   you don't want nobody watching you for your first video you want to be able to get those jitters out   talking to the camera is like it's a skill that you have to kind that i've i personally had to   hone in if i keep my first videos up for a reason if you watch my first videos i was like stiff in   front of the camera because it's like you're talking to a camera and it doesn't feel like   you don't even know your audience like i know some of y'all now so it feels like i'm talking to y'all   did i already put on my bronzer it feels like i'm talking to y'all so i feel like i have an audience   like i know that i'm talking to y'all when you're on youtube and you're talking to nobody it when i   was talking to nobody it was weird it was scary and i was thinking like if somebody finds me oh   my god i look so stupid you get in your head but those first videos are for you to get comfortable   like get comfortable sit down talk to the camera become one with seeing yourself on   camera and seeing yourself on screen i'm gonna do my brows i already did my brows y'all know i'll be   doing my brows before i get on camera it was way too dark but now i'm gonna go ahead and color them   in just a little bit more i'm gonna do the i'm gonna use the espresso micro brow pencil right   here and one thing i will say is i'm gonna get to the emotional side one thing that i learned that   i did was i started to i need to put some powder because my eyebrows is oily friend i'm gonna put   some um powder on my eyebrows one thing that i did and i still do i i'm not i do compare it myself to   people on youtube like they're growth i have been doing this for seven years if i wasn't centered   and i didn't live in reality i feel like i would be upset about where i am or be like man why   why why am i not further because i did have that moment where i felt defeated and i felt like man   you know like nobody's watching but i first had to look around at the community that i have and   be appreciative of the community that i have also i had to see like this is exactly what i wanted   where i was at the time is what i wanted to be right now and where i am right now i'm so   elated about like i'm elated where i am i'm happy to have this community i love how we communicate   i do things i'm doing things my way and i'm happy about it so don't compare yourself to other people   because you're you and being you is the best part of having a presence on social   media because you get to be yourself in front of other people and i love that people love   me for me and not me because of her you know what i'm saying my hand is shaking i hope you   all care about this subject because i don't know i'm just running my mouth my journey here on   youtube right now i can say i do not have a social life at this time   i was up this morning thinking about it like oh my god like i don't spend time with my friends   i haven't seen my family in a long time like it's just been me working and sometimes i wonder like   am i making the right choice um doing this and i think i have a struggle finding balance but that's   always been my struggle i've always worked more than i've socialized which is not healthy at all   and i'm trying i need to go to therapy for that because i've always had like an anxiety around   not having money so i always would work like crazy didn't matter what was going on girl i was   going to work i had one moment where i had like a depressive breakdown and i didn't work for like   six months like i literally laid in bed um for a long time so grateful for my amazing husband but   i did have a breakdown because i had done this so long i'm so afraid of getting back to that place   so i need to slow down i thought that my level of exhaustion came from having the job i had   what i realized having the job that i love is that it's not the job grows me it's me i got a   problem i haven't i have an anxiety around money that i need to work through um and being a person   being an independent person and i struggle with feeling like i don't like depending on anybody i   don't like needing people which is probably why i don't have girl i'm over here having cow flavoring   always have wanted to just need myself why am i gonna cry needs to go to therapy y'all know i'll be crying though so this ain't new here if you've been here   before you know i'll be crying i'm gonna use the contour making bets from lip balm i'm just gonna   use it on the eyes but you know what i'm saying like i miss my relationships and i just need to   find a way to consistently you know i don't even know if we keep this in here because i just need   to find a way to consistently uh get back to that and i think when i went to therapy before   my therapist had told me like you're in your 30s that is normal even though it's normal i don't   i don't want it to be my norm i notice i am much happier when i have a community around me and but   consistently doing it is hard for me when i'm always like i can work i can work i can work i   can work i can work i'm trying to get to the money but that's what i've i've learned more   about myself because i think sometimes i think sometimes we can think like   if i had this job or if i could do this that i would be happier or i would feel more fulfilled   i've learned that i thought that was it and that ain't it friend i need to learn balance   i do think it has like me finding my career that i love has opened up has opened up me   thinking like oh it's not what you do it's who you are girl you need to go back to therapy you   need to work out your uh traumas but what doing this has helped me to see myself more i do have   more time to spend time with myself to think to investigate to question how i think of things   before i didn't have the time because all i had to do was point at corporate   y'all the problem okay it wasn't them it's me girly doing construction in the hallway ciao   that's the end of that emotional conversation i don't even know if i can keep that in there   y'all may just see me go from no makeup to makeup   anyways i'm gonna go ahead and put on some mascara i'm gonna use the um smashbox super fan fanned out   mascara in the color black i just read that whole thing because i was thinking like oh   my god anyways i think the face turned out really good and it looks like skin i'm so happy about it   so y'all let me know what are they doing in hallway y'all let me know what you think down below oh my god all in all i can say it is success i'm the happiest i've ever been believe   it or not i'm just always open to being critical of myself so i don't want y'all to think i'm not   happy because i'm the happiest i've ever been but i realize what things i need to work on that's all   i'm saying but i am ecstatic i am in love with what i do i'm in love with my office there are   days where i'm not editing where i'm thinking like i want to edit i want to film like i'd be thinking   about it there's like an impulse to do it even if i'm like super exhausted i just love doing this   and i i wouldn't go back to corporate if you pay me well they do pay you but you know what   i'm saying you couldn't pay me enough to go back girl i'm not going back to this   club i'm just so happy i made that choice best choice i ever made um hopefully i handle that responsibly girl

This tells the platform that you find my podcast valuable and it   helps my podcast rank higher so that more creatives like you can find it', 'I really appreciate it and I love to shout out the people who leave   comments and reviews and I can’t wait to shout you out when I read yours', 'I love this comment from one of my listeners after he listened to episode   5 on five secrets to attracting more buyers with a personal brand, here’s what it says: “ I hadn’t really thought about the cohesiveness of it all', 'I   subconsciously noticed other artists putting their work together beautifully,   and because you pointed it out', 'I’m realizing that a lot of them use a color scheme in their   branding', 'Thank you for speaking this, and helping me make some connections.“ I’m so glad I could help you make those connections,   thanks so much for listening and I’m glad that episode was helpful', 'So in order to quit my job, I will have to calculate my living expenses   and figure out how much my business needs to make monthly in order to cover that', 'How much money do I spend each month currently? After adding up all of my expenses, including rent, groceries, my student loan payments,   Internet, utilities, but also the amount of money I put away into my savings, since I need to   continue having an emergency fund, and the amount that gets taken out of my paycheck for healthcare   and my 401(k), since I’ll have to pay that myself, all of that comes out to about $5000 a month', 'But keep in mind that this does not mean that my   business only has to generate $5000 a month because this is just my revenue', 'Revenue does not include your cost of materials,   your fees, your ad spend, or paying the people you hire', 'So this $5000 a month has to be in profits, and if my profit margin is 30% on average,   I have to make about $17,000 a month in revenue', 'So already I know that my business isn’t quite there since I have yet to have a $17,000 month,   but I did get pretty close to $10,000 this year,   and through all of the lessons that I learned about my business throughout this year,   which I talk about in episode 92, I am better prepared to exceed what I made this last year', 'A lot of this has to do with how seasonal my designs are', 'So this next year I have to see if I can make more in my slow seasons,   and one of the strategies that I have in place to help me with this   is sourcing products for my Amazon store that are not as seasonal and that sell year round', 'One of the products that I sell year round are my blank T-shirts   that my customers use to make their projects with my designs', 'But there’s a good chance that my slow months might still not generate up to $17,000,   which is why I also have to put energy into doing even better during my peak months', 'It will actually be much easier for me to make even more than $17,000 in a month during   a busy season than it will be for me to try to get my slow seasons to generate $17,000', 'So if I make enough during my busy seasons, which are seven months out of the year,   I can use my profits to help me during my slower months', 'So if I need to make $17,000 a month, that’s $204,000 a year in revenue', 'Knowing that that’s how much I need to make in the whole year, if I’m only able to exceed what   I made last year during my slow seasons by 3X, let’s say I make $3000 during my slow months,   that’s $15,000 total that I make during the five months that sales are slow', 'That means I’ll have to make $189,000 during my seven busy months, which is   $27,000 for each of those peak months where I get a huge volume of orders', 'These numbers might seem monumental until you have a data point to work off of,   so I have my numbers from last year which is my starting point', 'One of my goals for next year will be to increase my revenue during my slow months by 2 to 3X,   and I’ll do this in two ways, by being even more prepared for minor holidays where people still buy   designs, although not in such large volume as the major holidays, and by sourcing more products for   my Amazon store that are less seasonal, and that I can sell consistently throughout my slow months,   and I’ve been sourcing and testing at least one new product for Amazon each month', 'I wasn’t that well prepared for those minor holidays this past year,   which is OK, I wrote them down, and I made a calendar for next year so that   I don’t miss them and so that I can get designs out in time', 'And hopefully these strategies help me see more revenue during the slow seasons,   I’ll definitely let you know how that goes next year', 'My second goal for next year is to increase my revenue during my busy months by 3X', 'Now that I already know my best sellers during every single major holiday,   I can put those best-selling designs back out there and know that they’ll sell well', 'The advantage I have now that I believe can help me 3X my revenue is that I have   an email list in the thousands that I can promote to during these high-volume months', 'But this next year, I have a lot of returning customers that I have spent the last year   building a relationship with, and now they are far more likely to purchase again from me', 'In addition, I am much more experienced at using Amazon as a selling platform,   and I have a few products on there that sell very consistently,   and as I get more reviews on my products, they’ll sell at an even higher volume', 'I also know to put out my seasonal designs much earlier than I did last year, so I expect to   get lots of early sales from customers who buy their designs 1 to 2 months before that holiday', 'For example, last year I made a third of my revenue for Valentine’s Day in January,   and a third of my revenue for Halloween in September,   a whole month and a half to two months before the holiday even dropped', 'I’m really excited to see how I do next year now   that I have all of this data and information to work with', 'And once I do hit those numbers and I see consistency throughout the year,   I’ll know I’ll be ready to quit', 'It’s not just about matching the salary at your job,   you have to know how much your expenses are and your expenses are going to change if you   have health insurance through your job and have a 401(k) that your job matches', 'You also have to know realistically what your business can bring in not just in revenue,   but in profit after you’ve paid all of your fees and expenses', 'And you have to know how your revenue throughout the year will fluctuate   based on seasonality and demand during certain periods of the year', 'So there you have it friend, I really hope

how do we know when we're being called tospiritually take a leap of faith and number two is how do we go around doingit so for myself at around two o'clock this afternoon I walked into my boss'soffice with a lot of confidence and also a little bit of anxiety and I gave myresignation so to the average person that might sound pretty normal so youquit your job to me it goes a little bit deeper than that this is one of threepositions that I currently hold but it is the only one that is funding mybusiness the one that has the most stability and the one that has thehighest connections in my field so now you might be thinking why on earth wouldyou give all that out and for me it comes down to the fact that Ispiritually felt like to close that door and not shop there in my life and moveon to something else what that something is you have to figure it out but I felt- I'm to take this stuff and so I did and so how do you know when you'respiritually being caught him take one of these leaps for me it comes down towhere my decision is being based so I find that decisions are either driven bymy flesh or driven by my spirit decisions that are driven by my fleshare ones I often make when my emotions are at one or two one of the otherextremes one of the other one of two extremes and am either very excited andmake an emotional decision out of excitement or make a decision I'mfeeling a little bit more down or depressed and these decisions are onesthat I often have not put much thought into especially not spiritually so Ihaven't been praying about them I haven't been seeking God's guidance inthat decision it's just kind of spur the moment I feel like doing this I'm gonnado it that's my flesh spiritually when I feelcalled to make a spiritual decision I oftentimes have spent some time eitherin prayer or journaling but just trying to seek where God is trying to lead itlead on the steps that are going to follow but it's also one that this mighthave a men and despite having a bit of anxietyor hesitation or not being excited about the decision itselfI still have peace in my spirit I'm not questioning whether or not it is a gooddecision based on purely the outcome I am questioning the decision based onwhat my spirit is sensing and often time no matter what I feel or what theoutcome might be my spirit is usually at peace with making that call so that'show I differentiate where my decisions are coming from how do you make thedecision how do you take that leap honestly band-aid do it just do it justtake the leap don't overthink the outcome I am someone who really overanalyzes and really likes to rationalize a lot of my decisions and I have foundthat the more you do that the more anxiety you're gonna give yourself themore fear you're gonna surround yourself by so if you bought it to the pointwhere you're like you know what I know God is telling me to take this next stepinto you know the next chapter the next season that might mean opening a doormight mean closing a door and just do it if you already know is coming from Godyou have to just take that jump you have to look fierce straight in the eyes andsay you know what you have no control I am doing this if not we can often find alot of the time we're not just kind of standing on the shore of our dreams weend up facing fear questioning although you know what will people think of mewhat will happen to a B and C what will the outcome be what if I fail and allthese questions really hold us back from pursuing the fullness of our purpose andour calling and so band-aid just do it is it going to hurt maybe quite honestlyyou'll probably cry about it a little later I know that making this calmalthough it might seem calm right now there was a lot of fear around it therewas a lot of them questioning what will people think what will happen to mybusiness and is it really you know the spirit that's leading me and making thisbut at the end of the day once I have deciphered that I really do feel God iscalling me to take this leap there's nothing left for me to do but decide amI going going to stand on the shores and stay with myfears or am I going to trust a guy that hasn't failed me

are about to make a decision or if youalready made the decision and now you have to act upon it be encouraged andknowing that God isn't going to leave you stranded he's not going to like inthe Bible

right doors he is going tobring the right connections he is going to bring the provision that you needwill it always look like what you expect no God is kind of funny that waysometimes but is he always going to give you exactly what you need for thatseason absolutely if it is him that you are putting your trust in yeah so that'swhat I wanted to talk about today taking leaps of faith if you're

Yes sir Thank you This part of my life, this little part is called happiness but fast-forward to over a decade ofhitting all my sales goals putting my head down and staying loyal to one company and I wasn't any happier Although I was making the six figures and doing what I thought would make me happy I was living in a constant state of fear I feared losing my job, missing a mortgage payment, being a loser, and ultimately dying a lonely miserable death no matter how hard I pursued happiness I needed a break but first I had to confront my biggest fear Four years ago on October 1st 2014 I decided to sell my home My connection to my friends, my career, my tax deduction, and safety net against inflation I literally put my own sweat and all thedollars I saved eating the one dollar spicy chicken sandwich into this condo but you see this wasn't just a condo It represented the cornerstone of my American Dream A dream I wanted so bad that I chased after it like a madman eating value meals at McDonald's After seeing Ally that day, something inside Noah snapped Some called it a labor of love Others called it something else But in fact, Noah had gone a little mad But this madness is quintessentially the American Dream Buy a starter home, buy some tools, make it nice, and everything will work out Hello Hell, maybe even Rachel McAdamswill show up at my doorstep Maybe this was the case for our parent's generation but for me, it felt like the greatest lie ever created A lie designed to enslave me into an endless cycle of work, debt, and an insatiable appetite to consume more The American dream I had  truly was madness Now as much as I wanted to make a u-turn from this American lie I had a career that was just too good to give up but also I wasn't in a situation financially to retire I felt like I was just too old to start new but also too young to see out the rest of my days so trust me when I say quitting was thelast thing I wanted and I didn't even know how to explain it to my friends who would consider it an impulsive and irresponsible decision at my age but regardless of what my friends or family thought I knew I had to get out and it's been the happiest 4 years of my life I got to travel to all the places I onlydreamt about I discovered amazing countries and people Tried interesting foods and tasted delicious cuisines Visited crowded cities filled withpeople and activity and ancient ruins filled with history and culture of course I saw breathtaking natural sites and even sites that no longer exist but what made all of this even betterwas being able to experience it with my new girlfriend, travel buddy, and biggest supporter in all my endeavors Mayu I even eventually found a small condo to purchase so I never have to worry about another mortgage payment and pursued all the hobbies that I never had the time for including my passion for photographyand videography but best of all, I finally experienced freedom getting to choose the dream I want to live instead of being surrounded by a culture that isconstantly bombarded with media of only Hollywood's version of an ideal life so should you also live and travel in Asia? That's honestly a question you'll have to answer for yourself everyone circumstances are unique and even if you know it's the right decision I'm fully aware how hard that decision is to quit on something you work so hard at There are no guarantees that everything will work out and you're going to have to earn everything out here Just like you do back home but what I do want to do however Is share my experiences living and traveling in Asiaso that you can see a side of living in Asia That I didn't see growing up in America So that Hollywood isn't the only source of your information and inspiration If you agree Please subscribe to this channel and check out our weekly vlogs every Saturday to see glimpses of our life living in Thailand and traveling in Asia If you're more serious about making plans to actuallytravel or move here Check our in depth Wednesday Discussions and Neighborhood Guides for a raw unfiltered look at what life is like out here and if you want to support this channel even further Please consider becoming my Patreon as it's only with their support that I've been able to usethe high end audio and video equipment that make these 4k videos possible on my part-time English teaching wages whatever the case, please like, commentand most of all share this video with your friends and family to help our small channel grow and I sincerely thank each and every one of you for taking the valuable time out of your hectic lives to watch this video and then see you again next week for more vlogs about living and traveling in Asia This is not an any tour guides obviously there aren't people crowding this area for selfies but we're the only ones here we just are followed by this scent of incense It's so Chinese!

What it also boils down to is I didn\\'t havea \"why.\" I didn\\'t have internal motivation, and that\\'swhy I felt very frustrated, and I felt very stuck doing things that I was doing becauseI didn\\'t have a reason why, which isn\\'t a good thing because I personally believe thatif you\\'re going to be spending 70% of your time, if not more, at your job, you shouldat least really enjoy it', 'After I realized that I didn\\'t exactly havea \"why\" that was aligned with what I was doing at that job, the last thing that I did isI did a risk assessment', 'I wanted to see how risk-tolerant I actuallywas, and I think that this was probably one of the most important exercises that I didbefore I finally called it quits', 'What I essentially did and what I would recommendanyone to do before they pull the plug is to actually physically write down every singlething that you can think of that could go wrong in one column, and then in the nextcolumn right beside it, write down your solutions', \"Write down how you're going to solve thatproblem\", 'For me, what I realized when I was doing thisexercise is that I had a solution for every single thing that could go wrong, which mademe realize that I was in a very good position to leave', \"Even though I didn't have that much moneysaved up nor did I have a concrete backup plan, for me, doing that exercise was enoughfor me to realize that I'm in a good position compared to a lot of people\", \"What this exercise also made me realize isthat I'm extremely privileged because not a lot of people can just leave their jobsand go back to live with their parents\", 'A lot of people can be on their visas', 'A lot of people could have their parents ina different country', 'A lot of people could have a mortgage', 'They could have kids', 'What I realized too at that point was that,\"Damn, I\\'m still very young', 'My risk tolerance is very high, and so I wouldbe doing myself a huge disservice if I wasn\\'t spending my time doing things that are morealigned with my bigger purpose because not a lot of people have the luxury to do that.\" That is when I knew that leaving was the rightdecision for me', 'On top of that, my definitely for risk completelychanged as well', \"Back then, I thought that leaving my job wouldbe really risky, but in doing these exercises, I found that staying at my job was riskierbecause when I'm staying at my job doing things that don't light me up, I am actually takingtime away from me actually finding something that I enjoy doing whole-heartedly, and that'swhy it became very clear to me that I needed to leave\", \"I needed to leave to take time off to pursuemy dreams, and one of my dreams is to be an entrepreneur, but that also doesn't mean thatI am set in stone with that dream because what I want to also share with you is thatit's okay to change your mind\", \"Yes, I agree that you shouldn't quit somethingjust because it's hard, but I also think that you shouldn't be wasting your time on somethingthat doesn't serve you\", \"I don't think that you should be wasting yourtime on something where you can't connect the dots to your bigger vision, to your dream\", \"For me, even though, right now, I am experimentingwith entrepreneurship, that's not to say that I'm going to be an entrepreneur for the restof my life because you know why? I've never been an entrepreneur the same wayhow you have never worked a full-time corporate job, so that's why you have to forgive yourselfwhen things don't work out the way you think they're going to work out because life isall about testing and learning\", 'You have to test things in order to learnfrom them in order to come to your own conclusions as to whether it is right for you or not', \"With that being said, don't feel like you'regoing to be a failure or a quitter just because you leave your job because if you don't dothese things and if you don't experiment, especially when you are in your 20's, thenyou're going to wake up regretting, and for all that time that you were upset with yourjob, or that you were feeling so drained, or that you were feeling so unfulfilled, youcould have spent that time actually taking massive action to find something that is morealigned with who you are as a person and things that truly light you up and make you happybecause you only have one shot in this life, so why not make it a happy one? Another thing that I actually have to add\", 'Remember that you are the driver of your life', \"If you don't like the direction that you'regoing, then stir the fucking wheel\", 'Whether it\\'s a small turn like going to yourHR department and telling them straight up, \"Hey, listen', \"I don't like the situation that I am in\", 'Is there anything that you can do to helpme?\" or the big, big turns,

not on your boss to decide\", \"It's on you because at the end of the day,you live and you die with the decisions that you make in this lifetime, so if you onlyhave one life to live, then you better

and freedom', 'Also hit that like becausea simple like helps us out tremendously in getting the message of finance and freedom out to the world', \"Secondly, we have an epic newsletter, so many people rave about, it's awesome\", 'And finally there arejust a few days left, less than a week my friends, until the presale of ourcourse membership combo ends, so that means that after this it will become a yearly subscription, whereas now you get lifetimeaccess for a huge discount', 'So if you wanna find outmore about that course membership combo, link in bio', 'They often say thatworking for somebody else is a nine to five gig, and working for yourself is a 24 7 gig, and I can somewhat agree with that', \"Now, before you click off, in case you're considering jumping ship, let me just elaborateon this a little bit\", \"Because in my mind, whenI was pursuing the goal of becoming a millionaire bythe age of 30, which I did, I didn't care about anything else\", \"I literally didn't care about sleep, I thought it was really boring\", 'I just wanted to work onlineand make money that way', \"I didn't care about socializing, I put my family andfriends way down the list\", \"I didn't care about anything, I sacrificed everything to make this work\", \"Luckily, now a little bit older and wiser, I've learnt a couple of things\", \"Firstly, that whenever you'relearning a brand new skill and whenever you're reallyengaged in something, and you wanna make it work, you think about it all the time, you dream about it, you discuss things, you practice it all the time\", \"It just became my passion, so that is why I was doing this 24 7, I couldn't think of doinganything else, I was obsessed\", \"And the second thing, funny enough, that I thought to myselfwhen I reached my goal of, the success goal by the age of 30, was if I made this by the age of 35 it actually wouldn'thave bothered me at all\", \"(Sorelle laughing) Like five years difference, but if I didn't haveto sacrifice everything to make this happen, five years is not a big time difference because now I am freefor the rest of my life\", \"Basically, I learnt thatI could've definitely calmed down a little bit\", 'Granted I have always said thatlife is a series of sprints, and sometimes you do have to work overtime just to make your goal happen', \"Maybe there are somebeautiful opportunities that are being presented to you right now that you'd wanna pursue\", \"This idea of work-life balance,isn't accurate at times\", \"And I know in the future, I'm going to be welcoming thesesprints into my life again\", 'I now understand that thesesprints are just temporary, and they are gonna pass, and so afterwards I have tomake sure that I reward myself with rest to get theadrenaline out of my body for health reasons', \"But after being inbusiness now for 14 years, I can wholeheartedly saythat this is a venture 100% worth pursuing, and more worthwhile thananything else I've ever done in terms of my career\", 'I work my own hours, Idecide on everything, I control everything, I decide the direction of my businesses, what I wanna focus on, and so much more', \"I am the type of person that likes to take full responsibility for my life, and that includes knowing thatI am going to be responsible for taking care of my pensiononce I get old enough, I'm responsible for the bookkeeping, knowing that I'm alsoplaying with fire sometimes because business goes up and down\", \"So not knowing when myincome's gonna come in, knowing that at any point, everything could fall apart andI might have to start again\", 'But the growth opportunities you get from business is second to none', \"I don't think you canget this kind of a growth when you're working for somebody else\", 'You have the full weightof all responsibility on your shoulders, and yes, itcan be super scary at times, but man, do you feel alive', 'And failure seems to be alwaysknocking on the door for you, but you just always outrun it', 'And the failure whenever I encounter it is now just an opportunityfor me to reassess, reorganize everything, andcome back way stronger', \"So I'm not afraid of failure, I know that this is theonly way that we learn and advance ourselves\", 'At this point in time, Iwould really love to know who is a business ownerhere, who is employed, who is maybe consideringquitting their job and moving on to being a business owner, or who is just watchingthis for the hell of it', \"I know also I probablysound like a little bit of the motivational speaker right now, telling you how great business is, but now what I'm gonnado is give you the layout of exactly the things thatI have considered myself when I was transitioning, so you have concretesteps of what to follow before you drop everything that you have and create unnecessarystress for yourself\", \"So let's get into thingsyou need to consider before you quit your job, and move on to working on yourpassion project full-time\", 'Number one, calculate your expenses', 'All your expenses plus a little bit of living costs as well on top of that', 'How much do you actually spend per month? Now, when you have that figure, also break that down into a weekly rate, as well as an hourly rate', \"And you'll notice, it won'tbe so overwhelming for you to substitute the incomethat you have right now with the new income that'scoming in from your business\", 'And also, I just wanna say to this lady, the internet is the internetand it has no boundaries', \"So being able to make money online isn't reserved for ageographical location, anybody can do this\", 'Number two, no income is crippling', \"Don't quit your job untilyour income from the business is consistent for three to six months, and it is the same amountas your expense, or extra\", \"Three to six months means thatyou've now cracked a formula, and it's not just luck\", \"If however, it's a littlebit of a slower pace for you and you really wannafocus on your business, another thing you cando once your business for three to six months is making 50% of your living expenses,monthly living expenses, you can decrease the number of hours that you do at your job\", 'Or what I did, I started working at a bar', \"I saw the evidence thatthings were picking up, but I still didn't haveenough to replace my income so I started working at the bar\", 'I just wanna say oneof the stupidest things that people do is just toquit their job immediately', \"Some people are okay with that, some people are made for that, but you cannot be creativewhen you have bills coming in, and it's crippling because you don't know how you're gonna replace that\", 'How are you gonna becreative on your business because you dropped everything,and now you have no income? Ahh, this is just annoys me so much', 'I can tell you that thereare success stories like this on the internet and people brag', 'I quit everything, I made it happen', \"This is a very specific type of person, and if you're not that kind of person, you need some comfort\", \"If you have very little responsibility, it shouldn't be so hard for you to replace your income anyway, so it's not gonna take so long\", \"But if you have people depending on you, you don't wanna just give up everything\", \"But also don't use thisas a crutch for yourself, have goals for yourselfto hit in your business, and try to stick as muchas possible to those goals, because then you know you're on track and you're not just stretching it out because you have the comfort of your job that you haven't yet quit, and it's just gonna keepstretching out, and out, and out, and then you're never gonna make the jump but you know you really want to\", \"And for goodness sake,don't make the same mistake that I did in my first business,and that is to not sell\", \"I was so afraid of selling, and a business that doesn'tsell is not a business, it's a hobby\", 'Selling is nothing but giving the product that is so important, putting it into the hands ofthe people that need it most', \"And nothing happens until a sale happens, so you're doing them a disservice if you do not make surethat they buy the product that they need from you, so start selling\", 'Number three, part-time business', \"I will admit that the clip that I played of Joe Rogan at thebeginning of this video wasn't the full picture, but I was just tryingto illustrate the point that a lot of the timepeople get caught up in these motivational videos, and then they quit theirjobs sooner than they should\", '- And I think if peoplehave a regular day job, if you could just find some, one thing that you do as a passion project and just keep building on it, just keep watering it,keep adding fertilizer, keep giving it attention,keep giving it focus, and you can escape, you can escape, and you can be self-serving,you could be okay', \"- This is what I'm tryingto get at with this point\", \"You wanna have the security behind you when you're still working on your project\", 'So that includes working on weekends, and at night time towork on your projects', \"This is what I did becauseI didn't wanna quit my job, I needed to have stability\", 'So I worked in bars, I worked full-time in a marketing agency as a marketing manager, I stayed up till two AM in themornings most of my twenties just trying to make everything work', 'I woke up before work andI started working as well', \"Weekends were dedicated allto making my project work, and learning as much as possible because especially whenyou're getting into business and it's brand new, you don't know how this world works at all so you have to stumble a lot,and make a lot of mistakes\", 'Most of my twenties Iworked about 16 hour days, almost every single day', \"And that's why I said atthe beginning of the video, even if it took likefive years extra for me then I think I would'vebeen okay with that because I would've had somesort of a life in my twenties, and I can say very much so that I did not\", 'Number four, savings buffer', \"You've heard it before, peoplesay have three to six months of an emergency fund to helpyou in case things go wrong\", 'I called mine wisdom and immortality, and this was a fund thathad about six months worth of expenses that would cover me off in case things went wrong', 'But the thing is, Inever touched this money', 'I just had it there, becauseI had never in my life previously experienced the weightlessness that I felt when I had this money', \"It's like, there isanother level of your mind that becomes free becauseyou're not in that much of an intense fight or flight mode\", \"I can't describe it, I canonly tell you to try it, have this buffer behind you, and see what it does to your mind\", \"It frees you, it's amazing\", 'And then, so this is my wisdomand immortality bank account, which a lot of peoplecall the emergency fund', 'And then on top of that, I started saving for an emergency fund in case things did go wrong', 'So this one, I never touched,it became invisible to me, it was just there to help me alleviate the heaviness of the financial world, and then I had a savingsbuffer on top of that', \"So when you're getting into business, if you still have a steady job try to build these funds up a little bit, three to six months in thewisdom and immortality, three to six months foryour emergency fund\", \"So that means when you'reworking on your business, maybe already full timebecause you got to the point where you could become full-time\", \"Even if something goes wrong and you don't getclients for a few months, you don't have the stress because you have this money behind you\", \"Otherwise you start freaking out, you lose your creative mind, and you can't expand on your business\", 'Saving buffer, so important', 'Number five, consider your debt first', \"If you're one of those peoplethat just loves credit cards and has so much debt becauseyou bought into the lie that you need all ofthat credit rating BS\", \"So before you get into your business, it's gonna be so much harder at the start to pay off your debt withyour business, it just is, so you wanna do that whenyou have a steady income\", 'Think of this as a sprint in life', \"At this point in time, you're working on yourside hustle business, I don't like calling it sidehustle, part-time business\", \"You're working in your job,you're working weekends, you're working nights\", 'Think of it a like sixmonth, 12 month sprint of you just tryingeverything you possibly can to pay off that debt, as well as cutting back on entertainment, going out with friends,drinking on weekends', 'Just do it for yourself, a12 to 24 months sacrifice so you can be debt free,and start your journey of financial prosperity,is really well worth it', \"And also, when you can, cut up that damn credit card, all right? You don't need it, trust me\", \"I have never had a creditcard, you don't need it\", 'Number six, continue saving', 'Business is a forever changing landscape', \"Don't stop your savings adventures ever, also start learning to investwhen you get to this point where you have your wisdomand immortality bucket, and your emergency fund all saved up, then you start investing,these are the baby steps\", 'Once you have mastered theselevels as a business owner, you are now responsible for your pension', \"But it's okay because by 2030 ish they are already predictingthat the pension funds are gonna dry up, so you'rejust ahead of the game now\", \"And also, the pension fundsjust like they've done in the past have been stolen from citizens in different countries,such as Poland, for example\", \"So, it's not a good thingto trust the government with your retirement anyway, so you're just taking full responsibility, which business is anyway\", 'Business people take full responsibility for every aspect oftheir life financially', \"Congratulations, this is theworld that you're entering into and it can be overwhelming,it can be scary, but man, when you know you have fullcontrol, it feels good\", \"You're gonna feel like an imposter, you don't know what you're doing\", \"It's completely normal, trustme, this is how it works, but eventually you figure it out, and you wouldn't ever know how to go back into the other world\", 'That is it from this video, let me know what washelpful, if it was helpful, and also hit that like if it was', \"Don't forget thenewsletter, it is amazing\", 'And then the pre-sale ofour course membership combo on all things finance and freedom', 'If you wanna get lifetimeaccess for a huge discount, just a few days left'],

      "{'sentence_ids': [0], 'sentence_text': [\"i just left my job no it wasn't in a rage with me storming out of the office with a box full of   stuff and no i definitely wasn't fired or asked to resign for doing something completely scandalous   it just came to a point where it wasn't what i wanted to do anymore   but now i'm terrified this probably sounds quite irresponsible   not knowing what's next is a scary thing we're taught that we should go to school and get a job   but the thing is once we get there we're likely to spend approximately 45 years of our life working   and what's really scary is that a large part of the world's population   spend this valuable time trapped in jobs that they don't really care about or enjoy   some of us are lucky enough to get a lot of satisfaction from the jobs that we currently do   and if you found that elusive work-life balance you're one of a lucky few   however if you're not currently finding yourself waking up excited on a monday morning pumped for   the week ahead you might want to consider if what you're currently doing for work is really what   you wanted as a little background i started my journey of becoming an architect way back in 2009   it took a long eight years of studying and work experience to finally be able to call myself this   so it may come as a surprise that i've decided to leave something that i once called my dream job   to make things clear i still love architecture back in the day as a student i was filled with   ambition to perhaps one day go out on my own and become the next big thing   however after qualifying and finally accomplishing this goal i started to   realize that the likelihood of becoming fulfilled in this field whilst employed was really rather   slim and i started to ask myself questions like what gave me my sense of purpose to begin with   it quickly dawned on me that there was a large portion of my job that i didn't enjoy   i love design but i started to notice that i was only really doing things to help very privileged   people augment or multiply their assets which didn't really make me feel that good or fulfill   any sense of my life's purpose what i really wanted to be doing with my work was expressing   my creativity in a way that might help the people who need it the most while being employed i soon   realized that there was always a ceiling above me limiting my progression and my responsibility   a lot of times there was always someone above me calling the shots which often meant that there was   nothing that i could do to make projects run more effectively or more efficiently perhaps with my   comparatively small amount of experience it would be naive of me to think that i could do a better   job than those above me but really the lack of control began making me feel unsettled and i was   itching to get more control and fulfillment back in my life rather than just sacrificing my time   for money and things that i didn't really care about although i was comfortable in my job i began   to realize that a huge part of why i was keeping this job was because of a sense of security   we need to work in order to provide ourselves with shelter clothing and food but when you   really think about it job stability is really just a myth you never know what's around the corner   so a company might go bankrupt some new technology might take over your job or your own circumstances   might change very quickly so the sense of security that employment gives you may not   be as profitable as it seems when there's such a trade-off for what you really want to be doing so although being an employee in a successful architecture firm wasn't the answer to what   i wanted to be doing i still didn't feel secure enough to do anything else   and i really needed the money so i did the only thing that seemed rational at the time   and began to save i didn't really know why i was saving as initially all i knew was that it made   me feel more secure in case something did go wrong but i ended up coming to the conclusion   that the logical thing to do with that money was to invest it in an apartment in order to   mitigate the cost of rent and hope that one day the mortgage would be paid off in full   around the same time my mum began to express her desire to renovate her house in a way that would   allow my potential future family to live at home while she gets older so as a side hustle i poured   everything into redesigning the house so that it would fit a growing family i worked late almost   every single day we demolished walls built a new bathroom a new driveway and extended the house   all this additional work wasn't always pleasant at times but it was all towards this idea of   eventually being able to do what i really wanted with my life this new arrangement would also give   me the ability to rent out my apartment and for the first time i realized that if things worked   out i may be able to get some of my life back to give me more time to do what i've really wanted to   this is where things start to get a little crazy while all of this was going on the best possible   thing ended up happening i ended up meeting and eventually marrying my amazing wife nisha   and we decided to redesign the apartment in a way that we could both live in it together comfortably   and came up with the layout that many of you are familiar with from my minimalist micro apartment   video after doing this i thought to myself hm this layout could actually help some people   as surely there are a bunch of people living in tiny spaces with the same challenges as us   so seeing as one of my passions other than architecture is photography i decided to make a   quick video and throw it up on youtube to see how it might do and somehow out of nowhere this video   managed to get a mind-boggling 1 million views after making several more videos just for fun   this has now brought me to a point where this is a viable career option which still blows my mind   as i still feel like who would want to listen to me ramble in front of a camera week after week   and i feel like this is something that i shouldn't be able to do full-time just because i enjoy it so   much this experience has caused me to realize that employment and society teaches us that you   can never really do what you love because it's just not financially realistic instead society   tells us we should be cogs trapped in a world system that doesn't care for us one bit because of   that financial incentive the thing is money will never buy you happiness or give you purpose but we   still chase it there's literally somebody interested in everything and anything that   you can be interested in you will find others who also are so really we have a unique opportunity   to do whatever gives us our life purpose it just means we need to be willing to work hard enough   and take the risk if it means enough to us i would never have known this unless i had first   asked myself the question of what i really wanted to do and just gone for it the thing is the first   step is often the most scary there is so much about the unknown that cripples us with fear   however there's something that i remember hearing a while back which is life shrinks and expands in   direct proportion to your willingness to assume risk now looking back at my twenties i've realized   that every time i followed the inner sense of life and peace within me and taken the risk towards the   direction that matters to me the most it's always proven to be the best thing that i could have done   sure i've made mistakes along the way and will probably continue to do so but by following what   really matters to us it becomes the driving force towards the future that we really want   all of our individual situations are different and we can never know how long finding fulfillment   might take as life is just unpredictable that way but it seems illogical to me to complain about our   circumstance and put no effort in to make a change there is something about following our sense of   purpose where our continuously small inputs and improvements eventually meet opportunities which   is the fabrication of our own quote quote luck in being able to do what we care about the most   considering that we're likely to spend 45 years of our life working it's probably worth doing   everything within our power to make sure that we're doing something that we truly care about   looking back becoming an architect is one of the things that i'm most proud of and although i'm now   choosing to focus more of my time on youtube photo and video it is this that has given me the biggest   sense of peace and is the one thing that i'm doing which is pushing me towards what i really   want from my life and giving me the time for my life's purpose i guess i'm sharing this story   in the hope that it will help one of you guys who might be going through a similar situation   as i know stories like this on youtube really helped me on the path to where i am now we're all   wired differently and what makes you happy might not be what makes someone else happy and that's   completely fine but by really looking ourselves in the mirror and asking what matters to me the most   whether that's a career our family or our faith we can begin to identify the things that hold us   down and start to reduce their impact on our lives sometimes figuring out what truly makes us happy   can take a little searching and that's why i'm always happy to have my videos sponsored by online   resources such as skillshare although i'm an architect i began finding that i had a passion for   film and photography by learning things online and now it's become a huge part of my daily life when   stumbling upon this journey of becoming an online content creator i wish that i had some guidance   before getting started so if you're planning to or have already started sharing your voice online i'd   highly recommend checking out a brand new course on skillshare by the one and only nathaniel drew   in this course he gives incredible advice towards starting out including addressing insecurities and   developing your core theme i particularly found this helpful as even though some may consider me a   now successful youtuber i still very much struggle with these things on a daily basis what's cool   about skillshare is that it's an online learning community that offers classes on an enormous array   of topics like design business cooking baking or even things like flower arrangement to find out   more the first 1000 people to click the link in the description will get a two month free trial   of premium membership where you can explore your creativity learn new skills and deepen existing   passions what's great about this is that it's completely free to try out and if you decide that   you love it an annual subscription works out to be really affordable at less than ten dollars a month   what's more is sponsors like skillshare allow people like nathaniel and i to continue to do what   we love so not only may you learn something new but you'll also be helping us as online content   creators by signing up moving forward i'm likely to still do some of my own architectural work on   the side much like what i did with our family home but now by being in control of my time   it's allowing me to put out more content for you guys on a more regular basis and take on   more exciting projects of my own i've always wanted to help people who need it the most and   creating content online has been a great way for me to share my story and express my creativity and   hopefully it's bringing you guys a lot of value i can truly say that i've never been any happier   than i am right now and i hope that somehow my story might be able to help in some way or other   if you're currently finding yourself moving jobs switching careers or going out on your own i know   being able to do what you love doesn't always work out straight away and i'm incredibly fortunate to   be able to do what i do now and i have no one else to thank other than you guys i know this probably   sounds cliche but from the bottom of my heart i'm truly so grateful to each and every one of you   your support on youtube and patreon makes this all possible and knowing that i'm providing even   a tiny bit of help to one person's life makes it all worthwhile so thank you if you enjoyed   this video please let me know down in the comments below as i do read them and consider subscribing   or sharing it with a friend and if you feel like it turn on notifications so you never miss a video   once again i'd like to thank skillshare for
