well let's just let it out I guess so yes I did quit my job um that is so scary for me to say honestly um you guys know how much I loved it and how happy it made me but a lot has been happening behind the scenes and and there was a lot that went into me making this decision um now I'm okay with my decision so let's get to the reasoning behind it okay this all started when someone emailed my job so I would go live and mention to you guys that I was working and that I had a job there was people that knew where I worked and people would look for for my job and my job's email and some people did find it unfortunately and they emailed um my principal and that day that I got called over the first day that I got called over to her office um I kind of figured that it had to do with my social media but I could not pin my finger on what it could have been I knew that I was really careful with what I posted and just overall respecting my job so I went to the office and I don't want to get too deep into it but pretty much so uh that person emailed her saying that I was wearing something very revealing in one of my videos and and that I had posted a video making a poster for our my students and that the parent I don't think it was the parent but that the parent was really upset about that I literally started crying I was trying to hide my tears because I was just so embarrassed I didn't know what to say I apologized I took down the video um about that video I did post a video where I was making a poster for the kids but I made sure to cover everybody's faces completely guys so I'm currently editing the YouTube video but I just want to hop on here and like clarify certain things on the video that I didn't I didn't really clarify um so for the poster that I made literally the full video was me um making the poster I was drawing it I was coloring it I did show the kids at the very end a very small clip of um the kids it was their backs facing the poster and I recorded their like little reactions like pointing at it and being so so excited but I did make sure I did make sure to cover their backs and I am letting you guys know about this because there is a lot of rumors being spread on uh Tik Tok um there's people saying that I got fired and that my relationship is going downhill because I got fired and something about me not being able to pay my car I don't know guys my car is paid if you were wondering I don't know there's a lot of rumors going on and I'm trying to clarify every little thing about this whole situation because I don't want rumors to continue being spread so yeah I covered their faces with big hearts um if you remember that video you're no G but I did take it down uh but yeah but the parent that emailed um and I say this because I know that it wasn't a parent every parent that I have encountered has always been been so supportive about my social media so I kind of knew it was fishy from the start but yeah so I erased that video really really fast I was crying so much I went to my coworker and I explained to her everything that happened and I was just so upset um it was it was really upsetting just because I that's one thing I didn't want to happen was social media get in my way of my job and okay so that was the first time the second time someone emailed her again unfortunately and it was the time that e went to the club and she had my ID and someone found the purse but it was my older ID and they emailed the principal and told you that oh that this is this is the type of people you hire um she's letting an underage person go out using her ID uh that's very unprofessional just around those lines and that time the principal did tell me that she wasn't going to respond to that email she did reassure me and she told me that um pretty much my life outside of my job has nothing to do with her but as good as it made me feel that she said that I also after that they started feeling like I was walking on eggshells at my job everyone knew about my social media and it was just really uncomfortable there was a lot of people that were super supportive but after that incident I was just so so uncomfortable it it felt really horrible to be working somewhere that people decided to ruin for me you know and so so I am in college right now and I was juggling uh full-time being a full-time student uh having a full-time job and on the side doing social media I honestly loved it it was hard but I could not complain um so yeah having that happened I kind of noticed how hard everything was on me so I stayed with my job as much as I could um after I put in my 2 weeks it wasn't very long just because I wanted to stay until they found someone and I'm so grateful that they had nine applications ready to go um so it made me feel a little bit better about being able to leave but yeah I helped as much as I could and I hope they felt that I don't know I think about them a lot I still speak to my cowork my ex-coworker um and I'm so grateful for them 100% it was guys I worked there for 5 years can you imagine how hard that is and I love social media I love all the opportunities and meeting new people and you guys supporting my family but it has its downsides and part of that is people want to ruin your life which is so horrible to say uh I'm so grateful that I'm able to do school school full-time because of social media as much as this was a really hard decision for me I feel like a how do you say it tension is released from my body like I had mentioned it was so hard working after that after those incidents I was just walking on neck shells I feel like I would get there and I knew that everyone knew what I was doing on so social media and it just I had this fear you know but yeah I hope people understand that I had to quit I do say that I had to quit because it was only a matter of time before uh they received another email um that last email that I talked to you guys about about um Evis purse and my old id someone had had texted me the night before saying that they were going to email my job and get me fired and all that so I kind of expected it um and like I mentioned it was a matter of time before it continued to happen I didn't want to end on bad terms with my job I guess all I can tell you guys for now is I'm finishing school yeah I'm going to try to finish as soon as possible people started recognizing me at the school and that's where people would comment on on social media oh hey you worked at school oh hey I saw you at D School hey you're a parah at the school that I go to so that got really complicated um I don't know I just this was a hard decision but it had to be done for my sake so much guys I cried so much I was going through it because people were trying to ruin my life outside of social media which doesn't make sense to me but it happened and this is what it led to um like I said I'm happy right now I'm happy with my decision and I'm happy that I'm able to do school and finish it as soon as possible but at that moment like it was just really hard and yeah so yeah I quit my job guys I hope that answers a lot of questions for you guys and I apologize that I've been ignoring some of them it's just I didn't know when it was the right time to let you guys know but I feel like I couldn't keep you guys in the dark for too long so many cens I'm so sorry I was so nervous filming this so I feel like I didn't uh elaborate too much but I'd like to speak on how people are so against um doing social media as a job financially I'm so grateful for you guys and I thank God that financially I'm okay um and I'm able to do school I feel like I wanted to say that on this video but I just didn't know how um yeah so I'm super grateful that I'm able to do social media right now as my full-time job I'm getting so many opportunities and I'm so grateful um and this is allowing me to finish school sooner I'm so excited for that I never thought that I'd be able to um take School more serious and I think this is amazing so if you're someone who's against doing social media full-time I'm sorry um I'm grateful that I'm able to do this I hope you guys understand thank you so much for all the love and support I know that I mentioned that social media has its bad sides and this happened to me but it also has its amazing sides and I'm so grateful for you guys for the opportunities you guys give me and my family I love you guys there's like no way I could ever explain to you guys how fortunate we are for you guys thank you so much um but yeah that I guess I hope I hope it answered all of your guys's questions let me know if you guys want me to do another video kind of answering a little bit more but this was just kind of to let you guys know what was happening in my life but yeah thank you guys so much for watching I love you don't forget to like comment subscribe goodbye\", 'sents': ['hello Amigas welcome back to my

tell y'all about it now while I'm doing my hair I got time to talk so I mentioned in my last Vlog that I had quit my job two years ago and yes I did I quit my job um I went on a sabatical more or less but the reason I quit my job y'all is because I was going through burnout I don't know how many of y' have experienced burnout but um it's serious and it's real and uh my job was affecting my health and just to give you some background I've been doing what I do now for over uh [Music] over 20 going on 25 years now yeah typing I cannot hold on to nothing typing y'all typing um doing medical transcription for over 25 years now and yeah I sit at a desk all day typing sit down and for the most part I work from home but for several years I would work in the office I worked in a few offices and um the longest stent was around 8 years um in one office um so yeah it may have been longer than that y'all know y'all with my menopause brain and I'm not really I'm not taking the time to just think think right now but yeah um my longest stent in the office I know was around 8 years but any who around 20 2023 but even before that few years even before that I had been you know wanting to quit my job you know I was tired my body was burning out my wrists were giving out they were going out uh I started suffering from vertigo um of course I started having issues with my shoulders but now now I know that a lot of those issues were coming from menopause but at the same time my job was stressing me out and from uh what I listened to and typed all day it stressed me out y'all and um I was just tired I was tired I was I wasn't working out I couldn't find time or the strength to work out and I've always been a workout girlly you know through the years I've had my times where I be on it for years and then I just drop off and this was a time where I just dropped off um I was going through a lot um in my life which personal issues you know issues with you know family just going through some things and um I was burnt out I was burnt out and I had been flirting with the idea of daydreaming with the idea of quitting what I could do if I just didn't have to work of course we all flirt with that idea or have or do you know and I knew that if I could just get some time if I could just take some time off I could get myself together you know I could get my health together I could get my mental together and y'all in 2000 in July of 2023 that's what I did I I did it I just I just finally you know pulled the plug and put in my resignation I actually gave them like a three almost like a 3 week notice resignation and I said that you know I I I love the company I love my supervisors but it was um being it was very detrimental to my health and I had to I I just you know I I had to take a break so and I didn't tell them that I was if I was going to be able to come back I just said for now you know I can't do this anymore and uh of course um I had a little cushion of course cuz I was the main bread winner um of my household so I did have a little cushion not a lot but a little bit um and that was one of the main reasons why I flirted with it so hard is because I knew I could use um some money that I had you know saved up my 401k and um you know some some people you know they were like no don't do it don't do why would you do that why would you do that that's for your retirement what are you going to do when you retire you ain't going to have no money and I'm like look I need it now like I have worked all those years and saved that money up I need it now I can't wait till I'm if I wait till I'm 60 70 I'll be dead at this point I'll be dead I need it now I need the the time now I need the rest now like my body is not going to take this any longer and I knew that I know myself you get what I'm saying I know myself I know my body you know and I knew even my child even K was like Mama you are burning out and you're burning out fast she saw it because she's the main one here with me every day so uh you know I I struggle with it y'all I really really struggle with with um should I quit or not I struggle with it you know I had some personal issues with with certain people in my life with it and because of the decision I made um I'm thinking I may have uh brought on another issue that I went through once I quit my job but which I won't get into that but uh July 2023 three I quit my job my resignation was in and on the 7th of July I was free y'all and I can't I can't I can't the feeling that I had when I knew I did not have to clock in anymore and that my bills would be paid that feeling was Freedom that was freed freedom and I when I tell you that was one of the best times in my life but like I said I was still stressed it was kind of one of the worst times but the best time at the same time you know two things can be true at the same time but um y'all I took that time I worked out every day I walked I walked I listened to my music I um I took time to create I took time to work on my channel for the first okay for the first four or five months that uh July July let me see July August September October I think for 4 months all I did was rest and walk and work out and sleep and rest that's all I did I don't even think I really worked on my channel until around I started filming again around I think October maybe and my dates could be wrong but y'all can go back and look at my video and see when I first dropped my first video I'll have it I'll have it um tagged right here that's when I first dropped my first video after I was going after I had quit my job after I was going through what I was going through U menopause every all that it was all just intertwined just inter you know mixed up together I was going through it all at the same time personal issues um losses um just you know grieving and so no one died but I was grieving okay I just I'll just put it like that um just going through it y'all but I wake up in the morning feeling feeling refreshed feeling renewed feeling relief but at the same time there was something over here that was making me feel down that was making me feel depressed that was you know I was hurting over you get what I'm saying and um I'm almost suck cry anyway I'm not I'm not going to cry y I'm not going to cry but I would get out and I would walk and I would listen to my music and I would get inspiration and I would get um these you know uh creative ideas and how I want to further my channel how I wanted to revamp my channel and that's what I did and like I said the video that I have plugged up here that I put up here that was the first video that I dropped after me going through all those changes and just me going through that experience and um that's how I got here where I am now so yeah y'all I quit my job but the story continues and as yall know I'm working I'm working now the same job that I quit you know God is good you know God is good but um I'mma leave that that story for later if y'all want to hear the rest of the story y'all let me know and share with me in the comments some things that you guys may have went through if y'all um quit your job if you went on a sabatical if you had to get rest or if that's what you want to do and you trying to find a way to do it because you know you got to still you got to pay the bills the bills have to be paid you know but you stressed out and and and and you need a relief you need an outlet y'all let me know if y'all going through that because when I tell you I went through it y'all I went through it and I did it um I had a way I had a way to do it and I took it you know regardless of what you know other people may have wanted me to do I took it and I knew that's what I had to do for me

there for three years and I have zero backup plan um so I for some background worked for a tech company in New York City and I honestly never liked what I did basically staring at data and optimizing it um all day right so staring at a spreadsheet until it was literally burned into my retinas at night and yesterday I left the office to never come back so you might be asking why would you quit quit your job especially with no backup plan right because everyone always says don't quit your job if you don't have another one lined up and I know the economy the job market right now is definitely not great but you know let's talk about it so long story short a couple months ago a big mistake was made on one of my accounts and they tried to pin it on me you know I'm a lower on the totem poll they tried to put the whole thing on me and that didn't sit right with me because I had nothing to do with the mistake it wasn't my mistake so I stood up for myself you know I decided I wasn't going to let these fake corporate people step on me for their mistake so I defended myself you know fired shots back basically said it's your fault not mine right and then after nearly three years of nothing but positive feedback my new manager who's the one that pinned this entire thing on me all of a sudden had tons of negative feedback for me in the twoe period following this mistake that she made right and she said I needed to turn things around I'm not fulfilling the requirements of my role and if I didn't they would put me on a a pip which is performance Improvement plan it's basically corporate nonsense um that is saying you're going to get fired but we're going to do this before we fire you uh so we protect ourselves so one thing about me is you know I'm by no means the smartest but I am a hard worker and I always have been and here I'm being told I'm not working hard enough so you know for the last month or so at my job I reach new levels of try hard right I'm working 12-hour days every single day just being super extra with everything that I do like going the extra mile really just basically making it so she can't say I'm not doing my job um so then you know couple ago I got a call from my manager and she puts me on the performance Improvement plan anyway despite the hard work despite everything right so this is typical corporate nonsense and what I learned about this corporate world you know at my time in it so far is it doesn't actually matter how hard you work in the corporate hellscape right your input is genuinely irrelevant at most of these tech jobs especially like there's people that work their ass off and they'll put everything into their their work and they'll end up getting the same treatment as the people that are literally doing nothing just coasting you know maybe doing the bare minimum and you know if your manager doesn't like you at these jobs you're really cooked by the way you know I've had managers who love me and it makes such a difference like there's times I was like wow this job's so easy you know and and I'm still getting great feedback you know and then you get a new manager and boom you know you're cooked so and before anyone ask you know a lot of people were like why didn't you go to HR like this sounds like an HR situation sounds not fair here's another thing that I learned right HR is a total joke they're solely there to protect the company they have zero interest in protecting you so you know I went to them they did not help at all you know the HR lady was you know a remote worker who you know you know I'm not going to say anything but she had cats running all over in the background and that should kind of tell you the The Vibes um I have nothing against cats but you know what I mean right right and you know she's just telling me how they want me to succeed and you know they wouldn't have fired me if they didn't want or they would have fired me if they wanted me fired you know they want to see me succeed which is total you know [__] um so you know I have my pip meeting my pit meeting and I'm just hearing all this legit nonsense um and all these things that I need to do to keep my job and how much they care about me and and it may not feel like it blah blah blah at the end of the meeting I was just like yeah I quit like this is ridiculous you know all I can do is you know show up and work hard that's all I've been doing my whole time at this company so I quit you know I wasn't going to let them juice every last ounce of work out of me before firing me anyway I ended it on my own terms and every Boomer that I know including my own parents you know mind you told me that this was the wrong decision right quitting with no backup plan is irresponsible you know sometimes you got to just you know stick through it but I feel like if there's anything I've learned it's you got to do what feels right sometimes sometimes you you feel it in your gut and you got to follow your gut right so yeah I just quit guys you know I'm going to you know go travel for a little bit going to Italy you know Europe things like that I figured I'm only getting older right so luckily I've been able to save a ton of money up you know I've been you know I took the sacrifice of living at home for for a couple years so it's not like I had bills to pay um was saving a lot of money this entire time that I've been working here and you know also not going to lie a big part of this was like crypto right and I can make a separate video but I basically made my salary in crypto in the past couple months alone so you know I'm sitting here getting [__] on by these people that think that you know because they have a little bit of power they can just treat me like [__] and I'm like refreshing my crypto wallet seeing like this crazy number and I'm like yeah like I'm not going to do this you know I don't care if it might be irresponsible like for now I'm out of here and I I'll figure it out I know I will um but this is not for me clearly right so I feel like with my channel I don't want to make it seem like I have it all figured out because I don't right I'm still relatively young you know I've definitely learned a ton of [__] but if this is any indicator you know I'm still learning every single day right so I definitely don't want to come off as someone speaking from a higher ground right I'm right here in the trenches right now but I'm enjoying every moment of it right and before you make a decision like this if you're miserable at your job I would say like you do need you don't want to completely burn any Bridges like I really wanted to just say [__] you guys and just you know move on but you know I went to people that I had positive experience with I got reference letters and things like that so you know hopefully that will carry on if I need in the future but the moral of the story here is there's no loyalty in Corporate America right there's no human emotion it's all fake and to be honest with AI I'm not sure half of these jobs will be around much longer like so many of these people are genuinely getting paid for nothing like they are doing nothing all day and pretending to work like that's a huge chunk of corporate America right and I could have stayed collected a few more paychecks while they [__] on me some more but you know I stood up for myself I quit I ended it on my own terms and when I did it I wasn't sure it was the right move it was just what my gut told me but now you know this this huge weight is off my shoulder right you know I'm still young I have money saved up and I hated what I was doing right we spent so much time at work that if you really dread your job you're going to end up dreading your life right so I just said you know enough is enough and uh I quit so yeah I will you know say like I do live in New York City so there are a ton of jobs available as opposed to other places it's still a rough job economy like I'm not going to lie it's definitely a bad time to not have a job but I do have you know friends and connections where I can switch to another industry I I really don't think I'll go back into Tech but I just you know I'm I'm grateful that I have the chance to stop doing something that I dread and and I have a little bit of time and luckily I made some sacrifices and some smart Investments where I can actually focus on myself for a little bit and that's what I'm going to do so you know even these YouTube videos it's like it's like therapy for me just talking to like you guys I don't know it's weird but like this is something I enjoy doing after years of doing something you hate you start to realize you know especially early on in your career career what you hate and what you enjoy and you know that's why I'm still grateful for this this shitty job that I had for all these years you know even though I hated it I now know what I'm not going to do with my rest of my life and and I now know how to navigate this corporate world that we're subject to um so yeah guys I uh I don't want to encourage anyone to quit their job even you know I will say like there was times I wanted to quit emotionally things were were not going well but I didn't quit you know I stuck with it this wasn't really as much as an emotional decision it was more of a you know I got to get out of here before they can my ass anyway but I want to end this by saying if you're in a similar situation where you know you you may have a manager treating you terribly and it's just not fair don't let it get to you right because past couple months like I would work my ass off every day and and when you're doing that and no one giving you even a thank you or a you know good job on on working so hard on this it really gets to you and you start to question the value of your work and and I really was at that point um and it'll mess up with your confidence and everything right so I ended up going to people that I had worked with in the past and being like you know that just was I this bad of a worker and they were like no you're you're a hardworking dude and I knew that I've always known that about myself but it's like I started to question it because this manager who was you know making excuses for her own mistakes had me feeling that way so yeah guys that's that's it for me I think I'm going to make a video um on how I was able to to you know basically create my salary just by investing and and some sacrifices that I made early on that gave me this opportunity because the truth is if if I didn't do those things then I wouldn't be able to quit I'd have to just get [__] on and let them continue to treat me terribly so all right guys appreciate you watching especially if you made it this far uh

me question my entire existence so after two draining years instead of getting a new job I decided to do something a little different I decided to just do nothing at all I took a break a mini retirement of sorts today I'm going to be telling you the story of the time I quit my job without a job lined up cold turkey and how I learned that sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself is nothing at [Music] all I worked for Amazon from 2018 to 2020 as a software engineer between sleepless nights on call toxic managers and a pretty [__] Savage culture I was starting to go batshit crazy I made this whole video about what it's like to work for Amazon if you want to go check that out but tldr it [__] sucked okay I can't sugarcoat that I hated the work I was doing I was being treated like garbage and it just seemed like I never really got a moment to breathe so even as I started to look for opportunities outside the company you know looking to make that very fulfilling career transition you know looking for something more rewarding like being a software engineer at a at a slightly smaller company rather than a bigger company I know on to bigger and better things right I was so overwhelmed and felt underwater all the time that I never really felt like I was ever making a good decision about my future and my career like yeah turns out if you're going to be making decisions that are going to impact the rest of your life maybe you should get some sleep dude okay to my surprise there was plenty of other amazonians who were also going [__] insane they would quit on short notice and just kind of go you would ask them at standup like yo what are you going to do next and they're just like I don't know dude uh I'm probably going to get on a plane somewhere and uh not be here cuz this place just kind of made me question my whole livelihood and uh I am not even sure why I'm alive anywhere that's not here would be great like even out on the sidewalk like if I had to stay outside on the sidewalk for the rest of my life like I think I'd be okay with that like even if I was an ant and I had 30 more seconds to live before someone stepped on me I would rather get stepped on as an ant than Stepped On by my manager at Amazon on a daily basis anything but this my guy and you see these people and you're kind of just like huh being an ant on the sidewalk getting stepped on by someone that isn't my manager at Amazon this guy's on to something being an ant on the sidewalk who will live for maybe 2 days before getting stepped on by some random human is starting to sound like a higher life form than a dude working for Amazon That's crazy dude and I'm like okay I I need to get out of here I I don't know when but I'm going to leave all right now now hear me out what if I was not trying to constantly stroke my pride by being constantly productive what if I just didn't produce or stroke okay A a guy's got to stroke it sometimes but what if I just didn't produce but still it was a pretty scary thing to consider I contemplated it for months like doing nothing living off of over a Year's worth of income and savings and taking a break for my mental health having Rich parents living at my parents' house clearly having a background for creative and soft skills and not getting to use them at my deadend software engineering job where I was otherwise toiling away at the good old Clickety clackety at some Java code that no one understands getting verbally spanked in the ass by my Indian boss every day just [__] sitting there like shut up yes master such a scary concept I cannot fathom making such a drastic risky decision but on top of my own fears there was a lot of external factors as well everyone says it's easier to get a job when you have a job how am I going to explain to interviewers that I was taking a break for my mental health my my my future employer thinks taking a break is a red flag some Financial services company that's 60 years old that I desperately want to work for for some reason because I have no sense of selfworth but not just that what about the Indian parents how could I the son of two Indian doctors just making ends meet be such a disgrace not only to them but the entire Indian Community of Metro Detroit all my parents' friends who are well not really their friends all their friends whose dream in life is for for everyone's kid to not only work a miserable Tech job at a bigname company but also to vegetate on their parents' couch forever drinking chai and getting fat how could I possibly do this have I no shame okay but there was clearly a lot to consider here and it made it really hard to come to the decision on whether quitting cold turkey was right for me but eventually I reached a Breaking Point after getting scolded Enough by my evil infosis Alum Indian boss who had very particular opinions on very important things mind you such as when tickets get closed how many lines of code I was pushing out per month I I just started to hate myself and one day I I cried at my desk right when I logged in for work and I'm thinking is this all I'm good for like this might be all I'm good for all I'm good for is typing into a code editor and closing tickets like really fast maybe this is it maybe I'll never make it out of this hellscape that I once thought was the dream and in that moment some sort of fight ORF flight response kicked in I was like I need to get out I need to run far away from here bro holy [__] I don't know what I want to do this year next year 5 years from now I don't even know what I want to do tomorrow all I know is right now I cannot be here and so I quit later that day I finally put in my 2 weeks notice to resign from Amazon after nearly 2 years of service and in that moment I felt simultaneously relieved and excited but also [__] terrified dude like I don't know if you remember Peak 2020 but the job market was not good how was I going to find a new job but I kept reminding myself we can't think about jobs right now we just need to think about like 1 month 2 months let's just for now not be here let's just do nothing Let's Just Vibe like I can do that now I can just Vibe I had no clue what I was doing and that was okay one week after my last day at Amazon I hopped on a plane to Las Vegas if I was going to take such a big gamble on myself I needed to learn from the best gamblers in the world by spending my entire emergency fund on slot machines in Vegas just kidding I actually just flew into Vegas so I could drive around a bunch of national parks and hang out in nature for a week because blowing all your money at a casino is actually really [__] stupid and you should never do that anyway road trip when I landed in Vegas I rented a car and made my way to my first destination in St George Utah the whole ride there I just remember feeling free I didn't have a super planned itinerary I just had the hotels I was going to stay at and the parks I was going to go to and the hikes I was going to do on each day and the time I was going to go and okay actually I had a pretty involved itinerary and I should I should probably talk about this in therapy but it was it was scary being alone and kind of just doing this whole thing on my own you know what if I got hurt what if I got in a car accident what if I got hate cried in this random ass town in Utah but all I knew was I was free I felt like I was on another planet dude like oh literally and figuratively like the scenery was Unreal after settling into my hotel the first night I spent my first day exploring Zion National Park and like I said I had a long list of hikes I wanted to get through so I had a kind of tight schedule but Zion was absolutely amazing and everyone must go okay it's so worth it so day one overall a success but something was definitely off I I wasn't really feeling as relaxed as I wanted to on this epic trip a trip that was coming at a pretty Monumental pivotal moment in my life it felt like I was at a turning point but I hadn't turned the corner yet so to speak and so on my second day I had planned another day packed with activities this hike that hike that Lake that overpriced [__] parking like okay hold out nothing is more of a Vibe killer than going to one of the most renowned national parks in the world and having to spend 30 minutes looking for parking like I love nature and I really want the pictures of these mountains on my phone but this is not relaxing th this is the [__] Rat Race okay I was starting to feel like I was back in the [__] Rat Race and I was trying to get out of that [__] man [__] I left Amazon where I was competing with Indian dads and Asian dads for the next best thing and here I am at Zion National Park in the parking lot competing with Indian and Asian dads for the next best thing a [__] parking spot what the [__] but anyway Midway through day two I was getting a little fed up and I also felt like there was so much in the surrounding area in Utah that I could probably go explore for free and alone so I literally just open Google Maps and I realized there is so much to do in the surrounding area you know there's these things we like to go to called national parks but it turns out near a lot of national parks there's something a lot easier to access called a state park there was so many state parks and I just said let's go to one hey look there's a big body of water let's let's go to that one I I want to go to the water so I said [__] it let's go so around lunchtime I just decided to pack my things and head over to San Hollow State Park in Utah and just have my lunch on the water it sounds really simple but something about this moment having lunch on the water completely on a whim really ignited a feeling I hadn't felt in a long time or maybe ever again I had no clue what I was doing and that was okay just kind of abandoning the plan the to-do list just saying [__] it I see the water I want to go chill by the water and I realized this was really something I hadn't put into practice ever really deep stuff man like wow sometimes competing for that big dumb thing that everyone else is competing for will never match up to the satisfaction of walking away from that big thing and just going to that little Lake nearby that you totally missed on the way yeah that's a metaphor or for hey uh maybe every now and then just try to [__] go with the flow and maybe trust your gut dude anyway lunch success after lunch riding off of the high of discovering nature on Google Maps instead of all Trails I decided to keep going I found another awesome park right by my hotel the pictures looked good no crazy parking Soul by the way can you tell I hate competing for parking but this one hit different cuz on this excursion there was literally nobody else not a single soul just me and some Red Rock Having learned 2 hours ago that I can actually just do whatever I want with my life and not have to listen to my parents or a potential employer or some kids parents that I see once a year at some random dinner in the suburbs who for some reason feels a need to give me unsolicited severely outdated career advice I decided to just wander I didn't look at my phone and I just went I just looked around I found a cool looking Rock and then I went to the cool rock and if I liked it I posted up at it for a bit and then I'd keep looking and then I'd find another cool rock and then I'd go to that rock rinse and repeat kind of like a for Loop anyway I finally found a rock I really liked and I said I'm just going to sit here and as I sat on this rock overlooking the beautiful town of St George Utah I realized I was not only taking my first real break on this trip but also the first real break of my life my whole adolescence just kind of flashed before my eyes from day one of high school I felt like this new side of me just switched on a side of me that was meticulous about taking notes studying for tests getting good grades being in every extracurricular known to man I realized from that point on the beginning of high school I kind of just switched into Grind Mode and then I went from the grind of high school to the Grind of college the grind to get a really good job and then I went from the college grind to the job grind which is just well uh it's just a never ending grind that doesn't really uh go anywhere the grind that pretty much has no end in sight until now in this moment of reprieve no longer was I stressed about studying for Acts or the [__] coding interview I finally had a moment to pause I finally got to look back on 10 years of my life 10 years of doing the things that are best for my future 10 years of doing things that'll give me stability 10 years of doing the things that I should be doing and I finally got a moment and in this moment I finally had the chance to ask myself are these even things that I want to be doing dude look I I get that in life there there's always going to be boring less sexy things that you have to do to get where you want to go but but that's the problem here dude like I don't like where I'm going I'm not going somewhere that I want to go like senior software engineer staff software engineer even worse yet software engineering manager like you mean to tell me that this job that has drained me of my ability to feel emotions and all of my interpersonal skills where I get yelled at by an Indian man every single day will maybe one day reward me with getting yelled at by multiple Indian men multiple times a day the destination sucked and the journey sucked all of it [__] sucked I knew in that moment that something needed to change I didn't know exactly what that would be all I knew was I I wanted to be excited about how I was spending my time I wanted to be excited to live I wanted to be excited about going somewhere that I wanted to go and I wanted to be invested in the journey there doing something that I care about so deeply that I am willing to do the slightly more sucky Parts since I'd be doing something that's more connected with my purpose whatever that may be again at the time I didn't know what that was and no quitting a job and taking a trip through the mountains didn't really hand me a more fulfilling career but it did give me an opportunity to re-evaluate something about being out here in total silence in isolation really let my brain heal from a lot of wounds that developed over the years from working too hard to being overly critical of myself and taking advice from people that I should not be taking advice from this experience helped me clear the brain fog that accumulated from all those experiences and it gave me the opportunity to properly start fresh Meandering through the mountains with no plan just kind of seeing what I liked and didn't like and iterating from there seemed like a much better way of living life regularly checking in with myself asking myself the tough questions am I enjoying what I'm doing right now is it utilizing my superpowers is this a mission I'm excited about do I enjoy the less sexy parts is this something I want to spend every day impr proving again I had no clue what I was doing and that was okay I knew realistically I was probably going to go to some job after this that would have some pros and some cons a decision that after taking time to heal and reflect would have a foundation of full awareness to know if this job is the right one for me or not sometimes when we're on the job hunt and we're currently working at a job you don't realize how much your current job is hijacking your thoughts I felt like Amazon was really hijacking my thoughts as far as what my ideal career path could look like what kinds of job titles I could work how much I deserve to be paid Etc like when you spend enough time in a company especially one with a really strong culture you could very well be getting brainwashed so obviously when you quit a job you know you're losing out on a pay check you're losing out on stability you're losing out on predictability but when it comes to making your next move you are affording yourself the freedom of thought the freedom to kind of just think about things from a fresh slate like okay if this current employer wasn't in the picture like what do I actually want it's not about what my manager wants me to do next quarter it's not about what the company's goals are like what is important to me and not the [__] shareholders okay this is by far the number one reason I recommend quitting your job is just having the mental Freedom quitting your job without a backup plan just take time to [__] sit there and ask yourself what you want it's a lot easier to do when you don't have some middle manager breathing down your neck every day another thing people often talk about when it comes to quitting a job is this perception of stability in my time in Utah and really the whole time I was not working I started to realize realiz that this whole thing about stability is really just a fallacy when you take a break from being on a W2 getting a regular paycheck like okay yes you don't have the certainty of paychecks coming in every 2 weeks which can be stressful for a lot of people but as long as you have some way to fund your expenses which I recommend through a strong emergency fund for some people it's their parents whatever as long as you have a way to fund yourself the only only thing different about a steady paycheck and being self-funded and living off of savings is your ability to focus on your happiness Now versus some later date not later not some other place now when you are not expecting a paycheck to come in infinitely it forces you to think very short term about what you want right now and there may not be a better forcing function to get yourself thinking about what you want out of life life then not having a paycheck anyway I ended that day staring off into the sunset continuing to heal starting to wonder what the future held was I going back to school was I going to get a new job I didn't really know but all I knew was I was going to double down and stick to my guns on prioritizing my own needs I realized that this was something I had never done in my life just prioritize my own needs and what I want now not somebody else's needs not some uncle or Auntie's needs not my parents needs my [__] needs and nobody else's again I had no clue what I was doing and that was okay and also another really important thing that I learned about myself on that trip is that maybe I am not nearly as outdoorsy as I once thought I was like I'm sorry but dude the the Grand Canyon overrated as [__] after going to all these national parks by the time I got to the Grand Canyon I'm like bro ain't no way like 5 days that's about my tolerance for a hiking trip okay by the time I got to the Grand Canyon I'm like I don't know I I had two days planned at the Grand Canyon to go hiking down that [__] thing after the state parks and the [__] you know journey of Journey to Nirvana and Utah and all that stuff I was just like [__] this dude I just drove over to Sedona and and golfed and went on Hikes that were like literally 5 minutes long Sedona Arizona ideal vacation spot 10 out of 10 recommend anyway if you're watching this maybe you're considering quitting your job without a backup plan and if you are grappling with this decision there obviously are a few things you want to look into one how much money do you have saved up up do you have the experience to go get a new job the current job market conditions and what your actual goal is with quitting your job and I can't stress the importance of that last one enough if all you plan to do with your time off is dick around and Fab all day then maybe give it some more thought okay one of the best things about not being tied to a corporate job is doing exactly what you want so if you have that luxury make the most of it and be intentional with it do you want to travel do you want to pick up new skills or maybe you don't know yet and that's fine but high level it it is good to maybe set some intentions going into it my personal goal was to heal spend more time with my family learn new skills and just reflect on what I wanted to do next and I did that I took some courses I lived with my parents I took a job at a startup broke into content creation it was a very special fruitful time that absolutely altered the course of my life anyway I ended up taking two months off and after that I took another break about a year later for about 6 weeks and right now I'm on my longest break ever which is 5 months and I'm not really taking a break I'm going all in on content creation which is super exciting and uh yeah not working for the man is like really fun don't get me wrong though after the first break I spent four years working in startups which come with their own arguably in some ways worse set of demons and then I started working for myself which I'm doing right now which is simultaneously the most rewarding and the most anxiety inducing terrifying thing I've ever done but man I would not trade it for the world quitting my first job and taking a break would not have led to all these other jobs along the way where I had a lot of fun and made a lot of great friends and made so many great memories and picked up all these amazing skills it also allowed me to move to a new city which opened up all kinds of other doors and introduced me to other kinds of people and all of this stuff kind of encouraged me to like none of that would have happened if I didn't take the First Leap which is not nearly as scary as it sounds all of this kind of snowballed to get me where I am today 4 years later where I have never felt felt more fulfilled and free in my entire life dude it's it's amazing so you might be wondering Veron what is the plan now well right now it's pumping out videos for you cuz that [__] gets me going but what's it going to be next year I don't know 6 months from now I don't [__] know next week [__] if I know again I have no

let's talk about it long story short I had a situation where I called out and I wasn't able to come in um I didn't get enough sleep before work and I have been in a few accidents because of not sleeping and didn't want to run into that situation again so after having a conversation with my wife she said the best thing for me to do is to call out and I hate calling out um I always want to do the best that I can at the job that I'm working even if the job is a job that I don't like so I'm not very comfortable with calling out but my wife said in this instance it made sense and at this point in at this point in my timeline of working at this job I've never called out before so so I gave a call to let my manager know I wasn't coming in another manager answered the phone said your manager isn't here yet but it's okay this will be your one freebie and I said I appreciate it I came in the next day with full intentions of letting my manager know that I'm sorry and I didn't mean to bail on him last minute but it just wasn't a good time for me to come in due to the fact that I didn't check my schedule and I just didn't get sleep beforehand and I didn't want to you know run into any situation where I you know I fall asleep driving or anything like that and so as I come in to inform my manager about uh my apology before I can even get anything out he's immediately talking about how I didn't come in and and I try to explain my situation he says it doesn't matter and basically goes on to tell me about how my life outside of work does not matter because I am obligated to do whatever I have to do to come in and work for the grocery store also at the time my son was having some problems sleeping so I wanted to stay home to help my wife with that as well as soon as I mentioned my son he said that your home life is something you have to have handled outside of work that has nothing to do with me um and yeah I just I think it's crazy to see how different managers and I feel like Corporate America in general just doesn't care about their employees and they and when I say they don't care it's whenever something is happening outside of work whatever life you have outside of that company it's like they don't believe that life exists and as soon as your hours start at whatever corporate job you're working your life doesn't exist and everything involved with your job is the utmost importance in your life this was not a video I intended on making today but just coming back from work I really wanted to rant about this and I basically just want to let people know that it's okay to look out for your mental health I am an entrepreneur and I know that you know hustle culture says you know you got to get that money and I'm about that but if you're in a setting that is mentally wearing you down it's not worth it it will never be worth it in that case and I think it's important for us as entrepreneurs to know that you know if you're in a nino5 that you're doing to fund your dream and your passion make sure the 9o5 is something that you can handle physically and mentally if you're working at a job to fund your business and it is just mentally draining taking all your energy taking your mental capacity it's just taking up so much it's just weighing down on you so much you're not going to be able to put more energy and time into your business because your 9 to5 is draining you so much and also don't let people tell you that your life doesn't matter this man told me that what was going on with my son did not matter and the craziest thing about this is he has kids with me having my son I don't know how I could ever look at someone else and be like yeah what whatever is going on with your kid doesn't matter but one thing I did find out is that he's been working in the grocery industry for over 30 years so you know I feel like some people get so caught up in their line of work they feel like that really is what's most important which obviously is not true no one is going to tell me that stalking a grocery store is more important than my family that's absolutely insane if you're in a position or at a job where you feel like there is a higher up or somebody body that is constantly just hounding you about your outside life and just doesn't allow you to thrive outside of work or cut you down whenever something happens outside of work that is important to you you should probably leave because jobs like that they don't see you as a human they just see you as some sort of robot that just is only supposed to come in have no emotion and is only supposed to focus on the job which is crazy cuz we're literally All Humans we all have emotions we all have lives we all have experiences and things outside of our line of work and it's important to make sure that you hold those things dear and true to yourself if my wife has an emergency I don't care who tells me that's not important I will go and run as fast as I can to help my wife out and the same goes for you don't let anybody tear you down and make you feel like you as a person and your life outside of work isn't valuable because it is by the by the way how are you guys liking the outside video shot like never done this before this is obviously very different from you know the office shots I do but I took my dog out to use the bathroom this morning and I was like it looks pretty crazy out here it looks really good so I'm going just shoot a video super spontaneous thing to do but but yeah guys I wasn't originally going to shoot this video but I was just something I really had on my heart Corporate America can really feel like a killer to an entrepreneur sometimes you know as entrepreneurs sometimes we have to take that job in order to fund our dreams and you know it's not the most easy thing to do but sometimes it's the thing we have to do and one thing I will say is working a job you don't like to work to build a business or to build a a dream or a career that you actually want to do what I will say is I feel like it's something all entrepreneurs must do because it builds this kind of motivation in your spirit where you're like I don't ever want to do this again and then when times get hard you can think back to those moments where it's like yeah I'm never going to do this again because that moment where he told me my life outside of work doesn't matter made me want to be my own boss so bad and it's like I never want to work for somebody who can have this kind of opinion and and say these kind of things towards me so you know just work hard to get out of that situation whatever you can do cuz as a creative you know and as an entrepreneur we're we're really meant to work for ourselves we don't need someone you know telling us our lives don't matter we don't need people in our life telling us that we're not valuable it's just harmful negativity you don't need in your life at all so you know work hard to get out of that situation immediately like me as soon as that happened I immediately started looking for other jobs definitely want to give God the glory and honor for creating this video I hope and pray that this video gets to someone that needs to hear this and you know if you resonate with this thank you for taking the time to stop and watch comment down below if there's been a guys I don't know if you can

my warehouse distribution center job is for the last couple years before I put my two weeks in I planned my Escape behind the scenes really quietly without anybody knowing I got my home right my finances right got all my debt paid off stacked a lot of money and had something on the side prepared before I put my two weeks in and nobody knew I didn't tell a single soul until HR two weeks before I quit I was at my warehouse distribution center job for almost 12 years started in 2010 and well at that time that was a pretty good job it was a good work environment even though I was still loading trailers what I was doing was I was in shipping Department my entire 12 years loading trailers full of products to be sent out to stores well about year six into it I ended up staying in shipping but I put in a driving position to get on a forklift in a reach trailer or reach truck so my last six remaining years years with the company I was a forklift operator in shipping Department again you know it was okay about year six but I started to see a a heavy decline when management started changing when HR started changing and the company got bought out by another company now the job was still secured more or less regard L this company has been around since the early 1900s uh so it's not going anywhere anytime soon however I I quickly realized that the new management didn't give a [__] about the team members and didn't give a [__] about you know anything about kissing ass to corporate which I mean that's should be relatively comp sense about any job right but it's kind of you know not easy to wrap your head around when you this job you've had for so long was a good job right was a good job it's not like I was going into a shitty job to begin with where it was a toxic work environment for half my time there it was a good job then slowly but surely management crept in and started allowing really bad team members to get away with a bunch of [__] now I'm all for hard work I'm all for downtime as well you know when you get your job done and you got a little bit of downtime I'm cool with that you know I I you know I used to do the same thing but the job I always had to get done and the unfortunate thing about it is that the new management that crept into this into this Warehouse into this distribution center was so toxic that they would allow the lazy people to sit around on pallets go for half hour bath bathroom breaks take longer regular breaks just disappear off the off the floor go talk to random girls and a lot of the management would you know flirt with the with the with the team members you know they they formed their own little click and I saw that coming a mile away and I didn't like it in fact I became they wanted me among a couple other hardworking individuals in the department to take on the bulk of the work and for a while there I was stupid and I did and I found real quick that I'm doing more work for the same amount of pay I'm doing their work while they're slacking off and doing nothing while I'm getting paid the same amount of pay no promotion no extra money no no this or that the company started slowly going downhill no incentives to come into work no incentives for a lot of things and I'm probably preaching to the choir with probably 99% of jobs out there and hold on I'm not just bitching okay I I got I'm going somewhere with this about how I got out of it and why I think you should too the company the the management got so bad from top down that my wife actually worked there too for almost 20 years she got me in she worked there for 20 years I was there for 12 she was there for 20 and she even saw it because she put in to be a manager now like I said she doesn't have any you know no bad attendance no writeups no nothing squeaky clean you know history with the company for 20 years I had squeaky squeaky clean attendance uh Ross the board and no no strikes on me no write ups or nothing you know I was a hard worker I thought and she was a hard worker we got stuff done and you know and it's just unfortunate that the management even though my wife wanted to become a manager at one point they were promoting the wrong people it was the women that was going around sleeping around with the other managers and that were wearing hoochie [__] we're getting promoted and my wife obviously ain't like that and so she put in for manager three [__] times three [__] times she put in for manager and they denied her all the [__] every [__] time meanwhile they're hire they're they're promoting women that are sleeping around women that are flirting with other managers wearing hoochie [__] running equipment off the off the dock and doing all the just tons of [__] that they don't even know what the [__] they're doing but somebody who dedicated 20 [__] years to your company with a squeaky clean record who who's been in all the other departments every other [__] Department she knew the work of every other [__] Department you turned her down three [__] times and you hire the hookers of the company or you promote the hookers of the company what a slap in the [__] face man what a slap in the [__] face not only that but it was just you know I got tired of being used I got so tired being used for what for no incentive whatsoever other than to make to work more harder catch other people's red lights it was like red light [__] District dumping that [__] for some of y'all who don't know what red light means is that the the the conveyor belts have so much product on them that it's getting backed up that I ended up having to go up to these red lights because other lazy [__] weren't doing their job and it like it's like they the lane exploded and [__] boxes are falling off the [__] line and [__] and I'm trying to go in there and fix their [__] taking on the responsibility of the managers and some of their work to to get their workload to you know some of the their workload off their back so their managers and their iOS aren't jumping down their back in the meantime a half those [__] are standing at their computer ain't doing [__] ain't doing [__] walking around not helping flirting around with other team members sitting in their [__] office make making themselves look busy and like I said it's not like tiered I mean the next level up would have been because you got team members and that's it team members managers and above them were iOS inbound outbound uh uh management and then M uh maintenance and then obviously you got corporate and [__] like that but if you're just the bottom of the barrel team member y all get paid the [__] same it don't matter if you've been there what you know two years or 20 years yall getting paid the same and I dedicated 12 [__] years to this company man 12 [__] years my wife put in 20 [__] years for what for [__] what these companies don't give a [__] you could die tomorrow and they'll have a moment of silence over their pa if you're lucky if you were on their side on their good side no matter how long you were there you'll get maybe a minute of [__] silence and then they replace you the same day there's no incentive to work at these warehouse jobs anymore and it's not just because of the lazy people that they're bringing in and this is true I've seen it across the board at this job at this warehouse for 12 years and my wife seen it for 20 years they bring in the lazy people and all they do is sit around on their phones talking bullshitting around not getting the job done and this isn't just gen Z this is [__] Millennials gen xers Baby Boomers they're all [__] not working none of them are [__] working and you got maybe 10% 10% of the workforce in there is doing 90% of the [__] work for the same [__] pay I took on a lot of the roles of management doing startup uh startup meetings and [__] well that was my own fault but like I said my mind wasn't right because it was a good job for the first few years it was worth going into back in 2010 and then [__] just change with management and it starts at the top people want to say management want to say well if we could only get good workers in if we could only get good workers in that's like 50% of the freaking problem man half the problem if not more the problem is them the management they're the reason why people don't want to work for them because they don't hold other others accountable and they sure as hell don't hold that same standard and hold themselves accountable they don't want to get in there and help you out I'm not saying all of them there was a few managers in that company over the 12 years I can count on probably one or two hands out of hundreds though 10% were worth a dam and those 10% of those managers that were worth a dam were overworked themselves and their hands were tied and there was [__] they couldn't do but the other 90% the vast majority of management in these warehouse jobs they're [__] worthless man they're pulling them off the street with a degree instead of hiring within with people who have experience and know the building know you know know the system know the Departments you know and I'm not just jaded because my wife didn't get it three [__] times of course I am a little bit [__] them you know who you are if you're watching but it's just hire within like promote within man instead of P pulling people who have a degree your degree ain't [__] man just because you have a degree don't mean you know how to [__] do operations in a building there's team members that know how to do operations more than some of these [__] managers it's ridiculous it's not worth it anymore it's not worth going into these uh uh warehouse distribution jobs where you're you're treated like dog [__] and then you're you might be the 1% that's working hard the other 90% are dog [__] too they don't want to [__] work they want to sit around they want to do the least amount of work as possible and get paid the most as possible for as long as possible that's why you need to not not quit I'm not saying to quit don't quit because right now you need a job I'm saying use your warehouse job as a stepping stool to to quiet quit to get yourself in a place to where you can walk out and work at any job you want like I did and be happy doing a job you enjoy even if it's less money to where at any point in time you can say you know what I don't like this job I don't need you you might need me but I don't need you because I've been retired for the last two years and I made a video about how I'm trying to search for purpose like I you know I I had financially everything in order I had all my ducks in order to quit this job of 12 years and the reason why I didn't quit right away is because I have kids I needed to make sure that I had a plan in in place and it took me five years of the of the 12 years to plan to get out for my Escape I'm here to tell you you can do the same thing plan your Escape don't quit plan your escape cuz these PE these these warehouse jobs these these management they don't give a [__] they don't care and it's not just the management it is people that don't want to work man it is people and they sit there quietly laughing at you while you're hustling like a [__] rabbit all over the dock floor trying to get the [__] done in time just so you can go home and get paid the same amount of [__] money that these lazy [__] are getting paid and management is the blame who the [__] wants to work like that who wants to work like that and and on top of who wants to work like that who the [__] wants to be a management over that [__] has to change man it's crazy these companies the management does not care for you for me for anyone they're about the dollar and I get it I mean you know I get it Corporate America right corporatism I get it I'm for it too but at the same time grab your [__] balls managers grab your [__] balls Man start HR grab your [__] balls start paying attention to the ones that are depressed and angry because the ones that are depressed and angry are most likely the ones that give a [__] about your company the ones that are just laughing it off and chitchatting and [__] they don't give a [__] about your com they don't give a [__] about work it's the ones that become bitter in you in the job that you need to be paying attention to and it's crazy because that's what they want that's what these companies want is for you to become bitter so you walk out so you quit they don't want somebody who's been there 10 years 20 years 30 years they want you out I'm in my 40s now and I'm starting to realize late that you should never count on one single job never count on one single job for your finances for any kind of security because there's no such thing as job security always be up in your skills always be look maybe even look into a trade looking into bettering yourself and planning your Escape if you live if you work in some kind of deadend job warehouse job Factory they're all the same you know [__] everybody wants a a job with a pension well pensions are long dead and gone almost and everything's just a 401k now you know union jobs aren't what they [__] used to be either you know the union Reps don't give a [__] about you they just keep the shitty employees that's all they care about most unions anyways I'm not going to speak for all but most unions don't give a [__] anymore I want you if you enjoy your job and you love your job and you're satisfied in warehouse distribution work typical warehouse job more power to you if you're happy you're happy but if you're like me and you got sick and tired of being sick and tired of that warehouse job not so much because of the job itself but because of the work environment the toxic work environment and the shitty management plan your escape plan to quiet quit don't quit use it use that job as a stepping stone financially to get yourself out don't be like me man and invest 10 years 12 years 15 years 20 years 30 years into a company that don't give a [__] about you and that only promote the shitty workers the hookers of the company makes no [__] sense makes no sense man [__] makes no sense I'm definitely not saying to walk out on your responsibilities I'm not saying any of that do the right thing stick it out do what you have to do to provide for yourself provide for your family pay your bills stack some bread do what you have to do don't quit I'm not saying to quit I'm saying plan for your quiet quit I'll make another video on how to do that but warehouse warehouse work at least my experience anyways with it of 12 years maybe it was was just the company that I was with but I would assume the vast majority are the same we just want good management man because good good management good management real good management makes for a good work environment and that in itself produces good employees and team members nobody wants to wake up and go to a toxic job it's Soul crunching man man it's Soul crushing and yeah I'm bitter of course I'm [__] bitter man and now I'm just trying to find purpose now that I've been out for two years and unemployed thinking about going back to some kind of employment to find some kind of purpose because it's good to have purpose the only difference the only difference is I'm going to a job because I want to be there not because I have to be there cuz I got my [__] together over the course of 5 years in that work environment that I didn't want to stay into but I did because I knew I had to and I know you can do the same thing if you put your mind to it and you get discipline and you find discipline you can get to a place to where you can be somewhere because you want to be not because you have to be more and more people are quiet quitting their jobs their warehouse jobs their factory jobs cuz they're seeing that it may it may pay okay but the work environment is just toxic and the management makes it that way promoting [__] hookers in the company bringing on people they have no idea what the [__] they're doing how to run a how to run departments how to do any kind of processing
